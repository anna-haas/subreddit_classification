It\'s always going to be difficult. Which is why every single little thing that can help you is important:\n\n**- App:** This may sound pretty stupid, but I have a ""Quit smoking"" App on my phone. You input info and it will tell you the progress you\'re making and the health benefits at curtain moments (example: ""You haven\'t smoked for ... days, your taste and smell sense have returned to normal""). This allows you to actually SEE progress. I felt miserable the first  week so I didn\'t actually feel any better. Having something tell you, you\'re actually making progress is important.\n\n**- Distractions:** Keep yourself busy at the moments you crave cigarettes the most, for me this was in the mornings and after every meal. I started to eat at these moments (I gained a 20 pounds). I think chewing gum is a better alternative, try doing something that keeps your mouth busy.\n\n**-Support:** Also very important. Ask people around you to respect your attempt to quit. My parents both smoke and they stopped smoking around me.\n\n**- Timing**: People will tell you that the best time to quit is right now. And I agree, the sooner you quit the better. However, I found that good timing can really help. Both times I quit were at the beginning of the schoolyear. I think I was able to do it then specifically because the beginning of a schoolyear is neither stressful nor relaxing.\n\n**-Mindset:** I already said it earlier. I was absolutely miserable during the first week, I had every withdrawal symptom in the book. Every day without a cigarette was a hard battle but also a huge victory. I remember thinking ""this is hell and I never want to do this again. I\'ve come too far to quit now.""\n\n**-Cold turkey**: This is personal but I\'ve only been able to quit cold turkey. Building down might be better suited for you. I would still however try going cold turkey.\n\nThe most important tip: **Keep trying**. You will try a hundred times and fail 99 times. You only need to succeed once. The beginning is the hardest. My shortest attempts were maybe only an hour long but I never actually failed to quit after going three days without nicotine. Take your experiences from your previous attempts and learn what helps you. One day you will succeed. ', 'Have you read ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking."" It helps. It helps you change your mindset around smoking. It helps you move away from the ""I\'m giving something up"" by quitting smoking to actually helping you feel excited about it. \n\nI also think cold turkey is a good method.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[whyquit.com](https://whyquit.com) has some great info on nicotine addiction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m have been struggling to quit so I can\'t really talk like OP but these things have helped me. Good luck!  I\'m on day 1 and feeling good about it.', ""I always suggest to people not to look so far into the future. Maybe you're not *quitting*. Maybe you're just going to use all your willpower to not have that next cigarette.   \n\n\nOver time, not having the next cigarette will get a little step easier and before you know it, you'll be a year in.

I really like self checkouts and I always use them over regular checkouts. 

First of all, anything I get I have to carry up the stairs and down a long ass hallway to my apartment. I like to bag my own things so I can bag them in a way that's easier for me. I can separate what needs to be brought up right now and what can wait in my car for later if I don't feel like hauling everything up at once. Also, I double bag when appropriate and I spread the weight around so I have a couple normal weight bags instead of one completely stuffed heavy as shit bag. 

Secondly, sometimes I just want to get in and out without any judgement  or conversation. A while ago I bought all the Jurassic Park movies and the cashier told me she hated them. Like? Okay? I don't care what your opinion is of what I'm buying and I don't want to hear it. Or, they ask how my day is, where I'm going after this, if I just came from work, where do I work?

I think she must be 13-14, the same age as my sister. She was slouched back, playing games on her phone (without sound) and had her schoolbag besides her. I guess she just got back from school.

Across the cabin, facing the opposite way, were an older couple in their mid 70s. They were silently talking but I soon noticed that they were critizing the girl. I couldn't hear their words except for ""what a shame"". They shook their heads at her, unbeknownst to her, and the man even imitated her mockingly. They kept looling at her, with peering eyes. 

I felt so bad. For the girl because while she wasn't aware of what happened, she probably had a long day and was just resting. She didn't inconvenience anyone at all. 

I also felt bad because this is apparently how some elderly think of us ""youths"". I heard snippets of them being irritated at the lesser use of our language and people using more and more English terms as well. 

When I saw them get up for their stop, I approached, ready to say something about their behaviour. But as the subway came to a full stop, I couldn't get my words out, so they left.

That is wrong, the truth is

Our generation was a failure.

Thinking that

We actually succeeded

Is a wast. And we know

Living only for money and power

Is the way to go.

Being loving, respectful and kind

Is a dumb thing to do.

Forgetting about that time,

Will not be easy, but we will try.

Changing our world for the better

Is something we never did.

Giving up

Was how we handled our problems.

Working hard

Was a joke

We knew that

Sometimes when I would talk she and the other girl would give each other a ‚Äúwhat the fuck?‚Äù look and then laugh. 

All of this reminded me of people I outgrew in high school so I decided she probably isn‚Äôt someone I would want to be friends with. I know we aren‚Äôt all that different in age but she just felt a lot more immature than I am. 

The next time I saw her at work she was talking about making plans this week. Luckily I had family visiting so I wasn‚Äôt really available. She also wanted to talk about making plans in the future to go to the beach and stuff. 

I‚Äôm really not sure how to politely decline her friendship. Hanging out with her felt uncomfortable and we just weren‚Äôt on the same wave length.

In my friendship group, we have this friend who absolutely LOVES Indian food. More specifically, he loves a bhuna curry, and will order them whenever we have a party or a night out. This is to the point where we set his nickname in our group chat to ""Bhuna Officer"". 

And then we come to today. I absolutely love the bloke, so I had the idea to order him his favorite curry as a wholesome joke. I manage to sponge his phone number and address off him (and he now thinks he's getting a phone call from the police about an incident that legit happened near him, scheduled for the time it's being delivered), and I go to order the curry.

Next thing you know, 4 of my other mates chip in a fiver each, and now he's getting 5 bhunas, a pilau rice, a cheese naan and two pittas.

So yeah, this is gonna be interesting when it arrives at his later...

Have any of you done anything similar? I'm interested to hear!

As we're saying goodbye to relatives I find a freshly dead  raccoon. There's no way it was there when I went outside earlier as I surely would've seen it. We look around and find that one of our fence pickets is broken in half, this leaves an open spot to the woods. 

There's a clear sign of a scuffle as the fence picket is all clawed up and the grass around the area is destroyed. 

Now at first I thought that my remaining dog that was left outside killed it. But she's a small border collie like mutt and would not be strong enough to bust through our wooden fence. And then there's the fight mystery, surely the raccoon fought for its life (it even died snarling) so why is there no marks on my dog OR the raccoon. 

Then I thought maybe it just fell out a tree, it was laying at the base of one. But that doesn't explain what happened to my fence. 

We also heard absolutely nothing from outside, no barking, nothing. 

So what happened? 

Right now my theory is that something broke through my fence chasing it through the woods, while the raccoon was desperately trying to get into my yard something was pulling him from the other side. It caused to much damage and died in my yard where my dog found it and took it to the tree base.

But how this all happened in an hour and a half without us hearing or seeing anything is strange. And what broke the fence? It's all so crazy.

I dont feel great and figure i should go out for a run. On my way out, i see this really cute dog chilling though, and raise enough courage to ask the owner if i could pet it. I did but dog wasn't really feeling it and kind of aggresive, and ended up scratching me. Owner and me were like ""woah, guess its time to go"" and as i went i just started to tear up. 

I just felt SO bad about myself, getting rejected, by even a dog. (Not saying that the dog HAS to love me but you know dogs usually love everyone). I CRIED OVER GETTING REJECTED BY A DOG. It was wild.

The other time i was in an interview and the guy asked me ""what do you really want to do with you life?"" (It was not heading in a good direction by then lol) and i just teared up as well. And it was so obvious that i was crying and it was just embarassing.

Since I was 14 I have had two dreams in my life. One was to become a self sustained artist, not have to have a normal 9-5 And just be able to do what I love. The second was to have a seperate clothing line  (I have always loved clothing). Since that time I have dealt with so much depression, anxiety and all of life's bullshit striving to achieve this on my own since I didn't go to college. Year after year I felt more and more helpless telling myself ""there's so many better artists out there then me.. I don't work hard enough.. I'm too anti social.. etc"" 

Last year I fell in love with the Grateful Dead, and went to one of the Dead and Co. Shows. I was so blown away by the show, the community, the artists who contribute to the ""lot"" etc. And for the first time in my life of wanting to do something creative. I sat down, and formulated a plan to be apart of it. I knew I had a loooong way to go to translate the skills I have learned over the course of my life into a completely different skill and discipline. I spent the last year learning how to use Adobe products, design skills, and marketing etc. My plan was to create stickers to sell and give away to create a name for myself. Then after I have felt comfortable in my style to make t shirts and continue to grow from there. So far I have released 5 stickers on my Instagram, and have received feedback I never would've expected! I have gotten so much love and support from so many random people, and the people I looked up too and inspired me! This Sunday I released the last 3 all at once, and sold out in a few hours! I know it may sound petty and strange to strangers, just selling stickers. But in this community it means the world to me that someone is excited about getting something I made. Not only that but I have 2 shirts I am designing set to release in the next few months!.. It all feels surreal.. I had planned all of this and worked my ass off over the last year for it.

Lately I've been running out of work from time to time and management seems to be too distracted to direct me, so I've been tasking myself with adding captions to our videos, fixing any errors I catch in the videos, looking for potential leads or new developments we should be aware of, attending webinars, and setting up meetings with my managers to actually get evaluation and any assignments, instead of doing nothing.

I listen to podcasts, meditate, and try to chill for bit while I work, but I don't want to be a procrastinator throughout my work day, knowing there are people including my parents that work non-stop throughout the day on their jobs.

My manager states that he's really unsure of the whole state of what the company wants to do with our marketing department, and I'm getting the impression from him there is of uncertainty on what direction the company should go it (and what he and I should be doing, since the heads of the company aren't really interested in us).  I should also add that there is a another outsourced marketing department that produces low quality content - sometimes really awful content - but they cheaper.

Another Intern I work with is in similar case of running out of work and is not sure what to do, despite trying to look like he does - on Friday he emailed me job application for a job in another town. My boss said he may move me from a part-time employment to a project-based employment but is unsure.

I'd also like to add that I'm losing a lot of passion for the job. I understand it that most jobs are thankless, stressful, and just not what we set to do in life, but there have been two work weeks where I am putting more effort in actually finding ANYTHING do at my work rather than actually doing work to help further develop anything at company.

I'm concerned that my work in the company is going to be seen as not enough or unnecessary, and that I'll be fired and will have to go back to looking for a job again while finishing up my Masters. On the plus side, this could mean I have more time to do my studies and work on personal projects, but on the downside it could be difficult to get a job.

A relative says to consult with other family members on what to do, and to prioritize my education over anything else including finding a new job.  I was wondering if other redditors were in similar place and what have they done to get out of this funk.

TLDR: Running out of work, Bosses seem to be ignoring me, future of company looks uncertain, I'm reading these as signs that I should leave or will have my position removed, not sure what is the best course of action.

122,us1997mc,"['I\'m a registered nurse at a community hospital and I work night shift exclusivley, 7pm-7am. I love it because traditionally job will pay a night shift differential, so I make about 4 dollars more an hour than i did on day shift. \n\nWorking night shift is challenging, especially if you need to get things done during the day. I\'ve got a good little system of sleeping from 10am to 5pm every day, and I keep my nocturnal schedule on my days off as best I can so that I\'m not making too many radical changes to my internal clock. Luckily as a single guy with no kids, I dont have many obligations during the day, I can shop at 24 hour stores and get most my housekeeping done at night. \n\nThere is the downside of feeling like your days off go wasted by being awake when everyone else is asleep, but that will vary from person to person. My main hobbies are driving my car and using my computer, so I\'m less affected than some people.\n\nIf i do need to swap back to being awake during the day, I do what I call a split-sleep, where lets say I get home from work at 8am, I\'ll sleep till noon, and use those four hours of sleep to get me through the rest of the day until i want to go to sleep that night, either at a ""normal"" time or around 2am to 4am depending on my energy level- basically take an 8 hour sleep and do half during the day and the other half at night as I rotate my sleep schedule to being awake during while the sun is up in about 1 days time.\n\nMy only real advice for living the nocturnal life is to do your best to get at least 6 hours of sleep the majority of nights a week, treat it like normal. Get blackout curtains or a sleep mask. Nocturnal life can afford some interesting benefits, like not having to deal with crowds or traffic. I\'ve made a point of telling people, once you come to terms with how time is relative, it starts to become irrelevant.  ', 'My buddies fianc√© is a nurse that does the night shift and she does that same split sleep schedule to get back to normal on her days off. I totally didn‚Äôt even think about that. But I agree, some nights around 4 I‚Äôll hit the grocery store and I‚Äôll be the only one there which makes it a helluva lot easier than buying groceries in the afternoon. \n\nThe way I look at it too is that when I get to The Basic School in the Marines they‚Äôll have us on 48 hour ops with absolutely zero sleep. And during OCS we‚Äôll get a maximum four hours of sleep a night for 10 weeks. I guess I‚Äôm just preparing myself now for the sleep deprivation haha ', ""I still have a bad habit of pulling all nighters and it really screws me over.

I work for an IT consulting firm. A minor part of my job is to perform ""phone screens"" on perspective hires. I have a long background in IT, so I am used to ""resume padding."" I try to judge a persons actual technical ability, their ability to fit into our company, how they would do as a consultant, and try and get a gauge of their character. We have a wide spread of technical prowess on staff, so I focus on on the person. After years in IT, I think can do this pretty well.

Last week the owner sent a resume and called me to do a phone screen of a prospective employee. I happily agreed, not having read the resume. I finished my evening and went to bed.

The next day I read the resume.

This guy claimed to have worked at my former employer (a university). Nine years ago when I worked there. Doing my job. As a student worker working to gain two masters degrees in two years.

Before you start laughing, keep in mind this will mess with you. You don't expect this level of dishonesty on a resume. I started asking myself when I actually worked at the former employer, what I may have missed, what could have happened. I actually reached out to former co-workers about this person. I managed a lot of the student workers, but not all of them, so I thought maybe I was forgetting someone.

Nobody knew him. It was suggested that perhaps the resume had formatting errors or he was talking about the wrong university.

I decided to give the candidate the benefit of the doubt, but I wanted to be sure about my former workplace. I called the registrar's office to verify the degrees. After much checking, we could find no record that he even attended the school.

I should have called off the interview, but at this point, I was still trying to give the benefit of the doubt.

I called him on time, and started the interview as normal. I explained the position, told him this would be a technical interview, and answered his first questions.

We started going through his resume, and I asked a technical question relating to his claimed experience.

That is when I first heard the mechanical keyboard. I can not be certain (no video) but I am fairly confident that he was Googling the answers to questions I was asking. I adjusted and started asking follow up questions that would be hard to quickly search for. He was unable to answer those.

After a few minutes, we got to my former employer. I asked who his supervisor was.

I have never heard of the person he claimed.  I let him know I worked there at the same time he was claiming.  In the IT department, like he was claiming.

He responded with ""Oh, sh!t.""

I explained (briefly) that I was the person that would have been his boss, and that he was claiming to have done my job.

He tried to tell me that he worked in a different building.

This is when I got mad.  I told him that there was only one IT department for this rather small school.  I had to stop myself from calling out all the crap, instead, I just ended the interview. 

I wasted 45 minutes of my life.  Well, he wasted it.

I called the employment agency that recommended him and told them everything, including the bogus degrees. I then called several other agencies and gave them the scoop, complete with his LinkedIn account and resume that showed the same false information.

At work today, I was on break and don't have any of my books on me so I went to my locker to see if I had any stashed somewhere. Found a small, old notebook I had a few months ago I completely forgot about. Opened it up and there were some notes I had on a setting I was making for a Pathfinder game I was planning (think dungeons and dragons with different rules). 

A few pages after those, however, were some notes I wrote when I was in a depressive state after a hard break up. It was a short paragraph detailing all the things I wish I could do, but can't if I wanted to move on and get better.

Examples are: 
""I can't write you, I can't hold you, I can't talk to you"" etc. 

I remember it being a sort of final send-off for me and that relationship. A kind of ritual to start helping myself in a way, and I slowly and surely got better after that. I'd be lying if I said I don't think about her from time to time, but the emotions that come with it are very different. Before it was guilt, sorrow and longing. Now it's just regret for the hurt we did to each other. I'm happy I'm at where I'm at now. I love the girl I'm with now and have no desire for anything to do with the previous relationship. The affirmation I felt from that note was needed, and they are now in the garbage as I don't have to think about it anymore and haven't in a long time.

My favorite was lifeguarding at a beach for a summer. It was stressful when it got really crowded there but it was nice to be outside and get free popsicles and be able to yell at adults for being stupid lol (Something I wish other jobs could do). It was really awesome cause it was this beach that I went to all the time as a kid and I got to work there for a decent wage. We were employed by the city so I also got some good references down the road since I was a good worker there.

The head lifeguard was a really cool dude who had like 8 years experience, was a collegiate swimmer, and was training to be an EMT so I always felt really confident since as the head lifeguard, he was there all day every day and could handle anything if I wasn‚Äôt able to for some reason. We watched the same tv shows and had a similar sense of humor so it was always a blast working. Also worked there with my brother so it was great. 

The worst one I ever had was working in an Ashley Furniture warehouse. It was hard work which I did expect and didn‚Äôt mind but it was my supervisors/management that made it insufferable. We were very understaffed my entire time there and they‚Äôd constantly be yelling at us to hurry up when there were 3 of us doing work that required around 10-12 men to be done as fast as they wanted. 

Another thing was they were insane about keeping your shirt tucked in. Not complaining about having to do that. I get wanting us to look professional but we were in a dirty warehouse and our shirts would get untucked pretty regularly from moving heavy furniture all day and they would always seem to be right there ready to grill you. 

Like I said it‚Äôs not that we had to tuck in our shirts that bothered me but I saw a guy get fired for his third strike of being caught with his shirt untucked because me and him moved this huge bed frame from the floor to the warehouse and his shirt was untucked in the process by accident. The supervisor watched us bring it in and as we lifted it over some stuff and had to maneuver it around the crowded warehouse, it pulled on his shirt and untucked it and when he sat it down, he saw his shirt half untucked the dude fired him just like that. Just said this is the third time. You‚Äôre gone. 

I won‚Äôt go in to all the examples but they were giant ass holes that made me dread coming to work.

I am 17, a dude and from India. 

 This happened to me about 6 months ago when I was coming back from a friend's b'day party at around 10:30-11:00 at night. A friend dropped me off to a nearby street near our school and i would watch a rickshaw from there. Now this street was nearly totally empty. Any rick drivers I could find or passed were refusing to go that late at night to my society (about 25 mins away). Rick drivers often refuse to run by the meter and straight up ask for a fixed amount, which usually oscillates around Rs 100-150. They do this because they may or may not get a fair back from my society to here, and so wanna capitalize on the situation. Since, the fare by meter is around Rs 100, I was willing to pay if I could get home. 

After walking for about 10 mins and like 20 mins away from a main road, with my hand outstretched at the sight of every rickshaw, a guy on a bike noticed me. The guy was young, around 22-25. He came to a stop near me and asked where I needed to go. I found out he had to go right at the main road; I had to go left. But he told me to sit and he would drop me at the main road. Now I was cautious the second he had stopped (stranger on an empty street and stuff) but I was getting desperate. So in a move I was sure was foolhardy (and it probably was), I got on the motorcycle and he drove to the main road. On the way he started telling me that he had to pick his mom up from the railway station, but he had been in my situation before and empathized with my situation. He said if you have space in your vehicle and somebody is in need, you help them. If you can help, you should. By this point I was happy my country had such great citizens, but still had reservations. 

We got to the main road, I got off and started thanking him profusely. He said he felt bad he couldn't be of more help and asked me if I had money. At this point I got on guard again, thinking he was asking for money for doing this or something and lied that no, I would pay for the rick when I got home. He patted his jeans, found he only had his phone, put his hand in his shirt pocket took out all the money he had (Rs 20) and thrust it in my hand, told me to use it in emergencies , be safe and began driving away. I tried to stop him and give it back to him but he wouldn't have it, waved at me and drove off. I stood their stunned, for what seemed like eternity, waved for a rick and went home. 

I thought this encounter a lot and still do, because he had defied my expectations at every stage and done something selflessly. It has to be the greatest encounter of my life and makes me smile every time I think of it.

12 whole years of studying will be concluded by the tests I am going to do this week. However, the results won't affect my graduation (the finals were more like a national thing and were mostly used to rank the school) from my studies but still, I am nervous.

The preparation for this test had begun since October last year. Countless mock test and practices doesn't assure me that I'll do great.

My peers and I were pressured to make our school ranked higher than last year, especially my major. The other 2 majors in my school had received a pleasing national rank last year, and this year the teachers pressed us to follow the other majors' footstep. I didn't like how they pressured us to do it and just focus on achieving those ranks. They didn't give us enough materials to study, and just rely on our own capabilities.

I did a similar test 3 years back, and my school back then didn't pressure us or anything. They just wanted us to do our best, because these scores were not for the school, but for us. It works well actually, we actually received a pleasing rank that year.

I just wish my school would realise that, by telling us that we're doing this for the sake of the school's name, it decreases my willingness to work hard. I studied hard not for the rank of the school, but for my self.

About halfway through their ""training day"" I walked off and openly told a potential sale that this was some second rate bullshit they were pushing.

I graduated in 2015 and that description you wrote could\'ve been used to describe me. I JUST, like literally, 1 month ago, finally found a job in my field. If you\'re keeping track at home, that\'s almost 4 full years from graduation. I hope my experience can help you shorten that time significantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; After graduating in May, I looked for jobs until December. I just went on indeed and applied to 30 jobs using the same resume each day. Never got a reply.\n&gt; 2016, basically, was a blank year. I LITERALLY SPENT THE ENTIRE YEAR REDDITING, YOUTUBING, AND SLEEPING. You feel bad you did nothing for 1 whole day? Imagine doing nothing for 1 full year.\n&gt; 2017 is when I started to get my act together. I got a job at a local Starbucks, just to get me out of the house. I also went back to school to take night course to supplement my knowledge base. Around May 2017, I also started (I should note, I studied Engineering) taking all my licensing exams....which is hard work so I actually decided it\'d be a good idea not to look for engineering jobs while I was doing the exams, which I finally finished in May 2018. Glad to NEVER do those exams again.\n&gt; Finally May 2018, is when I started getting serious about the job hunt. I started networking on LinkedIn (super un-cool but do it, it helps!!). I paid the big bucks and went to a professional resume maker who heard about my 30 jobs/day thing and inform me about ATS (Application Tracking System), a computer program that matches your resume to the job posting and if it\'s too far off it\'ll just reject your application and ways to navigate around that.\n&gt; While the ATS did not pay off, Networking did. In around September 2018, I met a guy on LinkedIn, who I kept in touch with, sometimes even helped with some light programming problems with, and eventually around January 2019, when there was an opening he handed my resume to his manager. Who eventually hired me.\n\n&gt; Main takeaways:\n&gt; \n&gt;- DO NOT SPEND AN ENTIRE YEAR REDDITING!! PLEASE DON\'T, IT\'S SUCH A WASTE!!\n&gt;- If you don\'t get a job by September, start taking night courses and expanding your field. Project Management is always a good one, depending on your career path, it\'s a solid entry level position to get your foot in the door through, then find a job within that company that suits your career goals more.\n&gt;- START NETWORKING!!! If you\'re a bit socially awkward like me, this sounds terrifying. But do it!!! It does wonders. Networking is more art than science, so if you need help feel free to reply and I\'ll help you but I recommend getting professional help with this.*\n&gt;- Get a part time job, it\'ll get you out of the house. Bonus points if it\'s a shitty job because it\'ll really motivate you to keep applying to the jobs in your field. I recommend customer service ones, after working at Starbucks, I am a strong proponent of having everyone work a retail job for at least 6 months.\n&gt;- If applicable, take any and all licensing exams RIGHT NOW. You won\'t have the time later on, put the time to good use.\n&gt;- Go see a professional about your resume. My resume looks GORGEOUS. And I know that because everyone I\'ve ever handed my resume to says that, without me even bringing it up.\n&gt;- Please, if you have any questions, feel free to ask. I\'ll do my best to make sure NOBODY ever has to waste that much time like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; *My main method of networking was cold-msging people on LinkedIn until someone finally responded, dressing all professionally, meeting them at a Starbucks and having a chat with them, hoping they keep me in mind when a job opens up (DO NOT JUST ASK ABOUT A JOB THEY\'LL NEVER TALK TO YOU AGAIN, JUST SHOW INTEREST IN THEIR INDUSTRY) but there\'s probably more efficient methods. Also, to msg people you\'re not friends with, in LinkedIn, you need LinkedIn premium, which costs $35/month and they only provide you with 5 msgs/month. Again, if you\'re keeping track at home that\'s $7/msg. So there was a lot of anxiety everytime I hit send (""Well, there goes $7""). So, not cheap.

At the end of the night we were both drunkenly happy and tumbled into the subway. We were both students, which in our town means that we can take all public transport for free plus get to take another person on out ticket after 7pm.

So we're in the subway and the ticket man comes, wants to see our ticket, man. Now my friend doesn't like those ticket people and also likes to provoke. The ride was about 10min, the ticket guy came almost immediately when we entered and we were one of the first people to get controlled.

So I show my ticket. All good. Move over to my friend. He looks a little bit confused and starts searching his pockets. He has a lot. He wears two jackets (it was cold), cargo pants and a small backpack. He's got a lot of pockets. He starts with the first pocket and pulls out... a bunch of old receipts. He takes them into his hand, so that ticket guy can see them and searches for our student ticket (which wasn't a fancy card but just a wacky pinkish paper which tended to look like awful and butt whiped after a few weeks, but was meant to last half year). So he goes through it, loudly mumbling ""Hmm.. supposed to be here... Hmm nah that's an Aldi receipt.. oh look Jamie, that's the receipt from earlier lol... Nah can't be here..."" and moves over to the next pocket. Nah, just used tissues. Next pocket, oh I found some coins! Next pocket, wow I totally forgot I got this 10‚Ç¨ bill. Gotta put it in my wallet first, hold up. Okay, next pocket.. and so on.

Meanwhile ticket guy wants to write him a ticket and asks for his details. No, sir, no I got it. My friend gives him the 'wait a minute'-hand gesture and continues. Second ticket guy comes along, asks what's wrong, both ticket guys slowly get angry and start to pull out their phones to contact whoever was in charge. 10 minutes can be a long ride. Did I mention that the whole train was watching us? Some people offered to take him on their ticket, since he obviously forgot his. After a while people noticed what he was doing and the first started to chuckle behind ticket guys back. People give him a thumbs up when ticket guy isn't looking. Noone really likes those poor guys.

So our stop comes along. My friend checks his last pocket. The one where he knew the ticket was all along. The ticket guys (now 3 hovering above us) didn't check anyone else in the meantime, because they watched and threatened us). He graciously pulls out the ticket just a few seconds before the doors open and goes with all the relief he could force into his voice ""Aah finally! Phew, what a ride!"" and walks towards the door. The ticket guys look dumbfounded. I'm grinning all over my face and follow him. The train LITERALLY starts clapping. I'm not making this up. One guy pat's his back as he took the same stop as us and told him ""Dude you saved my evening. I didn't have a ticket"".

I apologize for probably being too graphic.

Imagine:

It‚Äôs -5 degrees outside and you just urgently ran home having to take your well deserved dump after a long day of work. You jump onto the toilet only to be horribly greeted by a seat that feels like ice, shuddering and trying to survive the cold. It‚Äôs feels like a punishment having to take a dump rather than an achievement!

But never again! Your best friend toilet-san is there for you, the seat warmed up and clean and he‚Äôs been waiting all day for nothing but your business. Control the heat and set it to whatever you desire or just time it so that it perfectly heats up at the same time everyday you‚Äôre coming home. 

Imagine, 

You‚Äôre sitting there, browsing Reddit, enjoying your business and overall just taking your time, relaxing, but then you realize- you took way to long, your legs are already feeling weird and itchy and now wiping this away is going to be such a pain. You mentally already prepare yourself for 5 minutes of constantly taking out many new layers of toilet paper, folding them up, unwillingly trying to perfectly clean up every single bit and just sitting there in disgust for what feels like an eternity.

But not anymore! No longer do you have to use super thin and crappy toilet paper and wipe forever only so your fingers reek terribly and your butt itches for the rest of the day.
Toilet-san is there for you. He gently and accurately sprays water onto your butt however strong or light you prefer, guaranteed to remove all and everything you don‚Äôt want being there without you even having to move a finger. You can casually continue browsing reddit,reading a newspaper or doing whatever your heart desires all while toilet san is taking care of the less pleasing things in the bathroom. Just lean back and let yourself be treated.

Never again do you have to waste millions of layers of toilet paper, calculating how much you can actually use until the toilet is gonna clog up and you‚Äôll be stuck trying to clean it up forever only to eventually give up, paying unholy amounts to your local plumber and regretting every single bit of your last bathroom visit.
But no dirty messes anymore! toilet-san does everything for you, carefully prevents waste of toilet paper, because you don‚Äôt even really need any in the first place and lightly flushing if you do end up using some anyway while probably saving you hundreds of dollars in the meantime. 

And even if you had a bad day and sometimes just feel a bit lonely, toilet san has your back. He  talks to you, asking for what it is you desire, trying to make even the worst of your days a bit more bearable for you, at least in the bathroom.


Toilet-san is my hero and I regret having spent so many years of my life in darkness, not realizing his beauty. I cannot understand how we are living in 2019 and this is not an international standard yet.

Principal has already sanctioned this. I'm the librarian at a K-7 school. She'll come with me in my car in the morning and a coworker will wait a few minutes outside with her while I go in and get everything started up. Then she'll walk in (through the playground like I did) with the coworker and go right to the staff room so we can meet up and plan times with teachers. The first is the first day back after Spring Break, so no plans really got made with teachers, but they know it's happening. Small school, 11 classes total.

Edit: We'll be dressed the same and have our hair the same. We're quite identical.

It's a good day to have it as there's an exhibit going on in the library and classes are only coming in to the library for a tour and lesson on it so normal library work is limited. I'm not giving the lesson. 

Our school is small and horseshoe shaped. Our plan is to never be in the same place as each other, but there's no easy ways to get around the building unless one of us goes outside, which is doable, but there's lots of windows, which could work. A lot of classrooms do have two doors that connect to the same hallway - so, same wall but maybe fifteen feet apart. 

One plan is to have me pop into classrooms to hand teachers things and chat for a moment and have my sister walk by the doors. We could also have one walk around outside while one walks the hallways.

Another is to have one of us check some books in or shelve while the other does something in the office next door - which you can see into from behind my desk. 

Nearer the end of the day we'll stand on opposite sides of the windows I have a display up in that I need to change and try and mirror each other, but that will blow the prank for the kids and we want them to be left wondering. Or do we?

I usually leave before the school day is out. Should we wait until the end of the day and then stand together? Or should we just go home and leave the kids wondering?

My sister wants ideas to fill the day so she's not sitting awkwardly in the staff room waiting for things to happen, though, and I get that.

She seemed so desperate that she wasn't able to get proper results from me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why it happens, but I have some clues. 

1. I am kinda competitive. When I get a test in school or in life, I always want the best result. It stresses me a little bit when I know I will get the results in a few seconds.
2. One time, they took info about my hearth in ER. I was waiting for hours and I was surprised when I heard my name. The nurse took my hearth rate and there was a loud beeping because it was too high. Since then, I am always stressed when they take info about my hearth.

So because of my high pressure, the doctor wanted me to go see another doctor (even if I am pretty sure there is nothing).

I just wonder how they will take my pressure if I get stressed/excited everytime someone take my pressure. I will end in an endless loop haha.

252,asymmetricalnoodle,"[""In high school, I wasn't competitive, because I didn't have to be. I was always top of the class, and I put no effort into it. Never studied, waited till the 30 minutes before school started to do my homework, zoned out during classes, etc. But it's the same story a lot of people experienced. Easily the top in high school, painfully average in college. I was used to being the best, so I started fighting for it. Always intent on doing better than my class mates. But after a while, I realized it was pointless. That struggle was only wearing me out, and I wasn't getting any better of an education because of it. I was tired. And that was enough to make me stop caring about any sort of ranking. I still pushed myself to do the best I could, but I didn't push myself to do better than others. Suddenly, I was actually engaged and interested in growing and always learning more. The best thing I did for my education was to stop trying so hard. "", 'Not as competitive as your school but the school I go to is ranked highly in the UK. It‚Äôs a lot of work but it‚Äôs bearable.', ""Are you in Massachusetts? I'm probably old enough to be your mother, and your actual mother probably wouldn't appreciate this rando's input, but you'll be fine. There is def value in working hard but not to the point that you're sacrificing your mental health. University is gonna be more of the same kind of academic pressure (depending on where you go of course) but it's more important to make social connections and have good internship experiences than you're actual GPA. Just my 2 cents "", 'Dude don‚Äôt sweat it so much.  You kids today are being told that if you don‚Äôt get into an Ivy then your life is over. I went to a tiny public school in the south, went to college on an athletic ride, worked pretty hard and got good grades but the only time I ever saw an elite private school was when we ran against them. \n\nNow I have my own business and love what I do. I have hired kids who went to school like yours and then Harvard or Penn or Chicago and while they are definitely smart and well educated they usually can‚Äôt think their way out of a paper bag. And they have no concept of life balance or how to have fun.

Did all of it just to not get the degree at the end for failing gym.\n\nIf I can pass anything on to someone who is still stuck in an academically competitive environment: your professors and the system your school runs on is NOT built with you in mind. You will be treated like an adult when you voice that you're having a hard time completing your work in that they'll insist you change your habits to do the utmost, and then like a child when you begin to slip because of personal issues. I'm not saying that you should say screw the whole thing entirely, but THERE IS A LIFE FOR YOU OUTSIDE OF ACADEMICS/THEIR EXPECTATIONS. You are never a failure because you fail to comply to THEIR expectations of you. Life will always bring experiences to your door, and there will always be chances for you to grow and find your specific path. It just might be hard to feel that way when your professors, who are supposed to support every student equally, let the kids who fall to the wayside stay there. \n\nI get worked up over this because I was hospitalized senior year of high school, and when I got out the staff was supportive up until I started to miss class and fail to complete assignments. Without even asking me what was happening, and trusting the opinions of adults who didn't know me and were going off assumptions, they labeled me as a fuck up in their own heads and that was that. My guidance counselor even told me I was immature. And again, I didn't get an associates because I failed gym. "", 'I feel you.\n\nMy high school is like this.

But I think this environment promotes the feeling that you\'ll never be good enough. I\'ve heard half my classmates complain about their 1400+ SAT scores being very low. I\'ve heard kids in my AP physics class complaining about how bad they\'re doing or how they ""failed"" the test because they got a 70%. \n\n\nI think it\'s legitimately damaging and unhealthy.

I teach math at a centre and kids often tell me that they are in a hurry to get to language class, go to various sports meets etc that didn't seem to be the case when I was that age. It's kinda weird that even at that age, they're already lacking in free time.\n\nAlthough I have not yet graduated, I was someone who didn't have an internship or job in high school.

The end of year tests consisted of three different scores (english, math, and science) of 1-4 each. After taking the test, I found out the truth.  The first time, I had gotten two 4s, and a 3. The previous year, I had gotten all 4s. It wouldn't help the school's ranking if I hadn't improved my scores from the previous year, but it would have zero impact on me and whether or not I moved on to 9th grade.

I'm also struggling a bit with a couple of my classes.  My wife and I have a 3 month old baby boy, and I think between taking care of him, doing job interviews, and taking high-level CS courses has led me to feel a bit overwhelmed and fall a bit behind.

So in the case that I get a full-time job offer, but end up not passing one of my classes, should I tell them?

My reasoning is:
1.  If I get the job and fail a class, I can probably just take it as a night class later.  The class has nothing to do with what I'd be doing on the job anyway.  So if the employer feels like they need to let me go if I don't graduate, then I might be inclined not to tell them.

2.  Maybe I should tell them just to be honest.  I don't think I'll be working in any real ""contract"" specification (meaning I believe the company requiring a BS degree for this job is just a company rule, not a requirement for employees by contractors).  So maybe they'll understand and let me keep working while I retake that class.

All of you, at some point, have watched a movie, a TV series or read a book in which a villain had a rather important role. And I'm pretty sure you, at some point looked at that character and thought something like ""Well, he's a bastard, but gotta admit he's got a point"" or ""Wow, this guy's interesting!"".

Why are we fond of fictional-villains but not of the ones that go around our world? 

I think the answer is pretty obvious (well, I think so now that I thought of it lol): the fact that they are *real* is what changes the way we look at them. We can't look at them like we look at, for example, The Joker, because, unlike him, they can actually hurt us.

When I was 18 and dumb I Fell out of the car... I was driving. One night I was on my way to meet up with some big booty chicks. My transmission goes out about 5 minutes away from home. Brother is in passenger seat. We sit there on main street and call my friend to come pick us up. While waiting I turn the car back on to see if anything changed and to my surprise I can move the vehicle, but not for long. The throttle would stop responding the longer I drove the car so I was pretty much coasting to a stop. Friend pulls up behind us and I explained what was happening. When then realize that I'm only a mile from home but it's all side streets. So theoretically I could just drive till the throttle stops responding and coast home. Here comes the dumb... I turn the car back on and floor it. Tell my friend to stay close behind. Get up to like 80 on a 25mph side street (thank God there were no cops or kids playing on the street). Car starts slowing down, I hit a corner at like 30mph. We were just down the street from my house when the car significantly slows down - you know how when your driving on the freeway 60mph doesn't feel fast because everything is moving relative to your speed? Yeah well it was night and my mind played tricks on me so what felt slow was still fast seeing as I just went from 80mph to 30ishmph. I had to make a decision - so I yell at my bro in the passenger seat ""hey you steer the car while I hop and and push!"" and without a brain cell of hesitation I open the door and step out the car... Immediately get sucked under and ran over by my own damn car, I hit bounce off the street a couple times while hearing the fading screams of my bro as the car ghost rides down the street with no one at the wheel. my friend behind me swerves out the way cause he almost ran me over! Everything happened so quick. My brother is still in the passenger seat btw screaming and leans over to steer the car and simultaneously hit the brakes, with his hands, and wouldn't you know it this goofball actually makes it into our driveway... But he hits the house. Not much damage was done to it though. I surprisingly didn't break anything but I was bruised and had a hard time walking for weeks. Face was numb too for a few days.

We cherish this moment and no one ever believes us when we tell it. Our neighbors didn't see, parents were at work that night and I didn't die. All things considered it went pretty well.

Recently, I secretly tried beer. I grow up in a Baptist Christian home and I still live with my parents while I attend college. I'm above the legal drinking age but my parents have a no-alcohol policy (unless it's for cooking). I've been curious about the taste of beer for most of my life but I never got the chance to try it.

During the day while nobody was home, I started with Heineken 0.0 because I was too nervous to try alcoholic beer, but I didn't like the taste because it reminded me of ginger-ale (and I hate ginger-ale). So later I bought a bottle of Samuel Adams Boston Lager and hid it in my room where I know nobody would ever look while my parents weren't home. I put it on ice and waited until everyone was asleep before drinking it. When I finally got around to trying it, I thought it had a crisp, slightly nutty, slightly sweet yet bitter flavor. I was pleasantly surprised. Surprisingly, I didn't even get buzzed, and I drank the whole thing. I didn't care because I wasn't interested in getting drunk anyway.

I came back on Sunday around 4pm and R didn‚Äôt come to the front door to greet me which was kind of weird but not completely bizarre, maybe he was in a real deep nap, right? My roommate, M, and I eventually sit down to chat and watch the rest of True Detective. R will ALWAYS come to the living room to watch shows with us. So as soon as I said to M, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird, where‚Äôs R?‚Äù M‚Äôs face just drained of color and he said, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? I thought you took him to your SO‚Äôs Friday night?? He‚Äôs not here?‚Äù 

We both proceed to panic and look everywhere in the apartment. I see that I left one of my windows open and some of the screen was broken so I immediately picture R jumping from our 4th floor to the ground below, dead, and I end up having the second panic attack I‚Äôve ever had in my life, the first one happening about 13 years ago. I scream, cry, curse, yell, call my landlord who is like a surrogate father at this point (I‚Äôve lived in this building for 6 years) who comes by to help with the search within 20 minutes. My SO also drives over. 

We check the entire building, knocking on all the doors, basement all the way to the roof. Nothing. Neighbors tell us they saw him in the hallways around midnight Friday but no one ever knew he was mine or whose cat it was. At this point I‚Äôm convinced he got let out into the world (I live in a major city) and I‚Äôm going through literally all of the feelings. We talk to everyone on the street, walking down all of the blocks within the radius, into bodegas, I must have given 15+ people my number in the neighborhood. One girl on the street says she saw a cat that looked like mine over in her neighborhood, a 25 minute walk away. We drive over to that neighborhood and walk around, I‚Äôm shrieking his name every minute or two. Nothing.

We go back to our neighborhood and we‚Äôre told by another person that there‚Äôs a lady who feeds street cats around 1am a block away. At this point it‚Äôs about 11pm and I‚Äôve been losing my shit since 6pm. I saw a couple cats that looked like R, one I was so convinced it was him that I chased him over someone‚Äôs fence and into their backyard which resulted in 2 people coming out of their homes scared as fuck. I apologized profusely and explained what was going on but yes, I was trespassing like hell and I would‚Äôve done it again. Waiting for 12:30am to go back out to see the cat lady a block away, I make a post on Craigslist and Pawboost and any other place I could think to spread the word. We go down the block and post up until about 1:30, no cat lady.

We eventually meet back up, me and M, at the front of our building at around 1:45. I say, Let‚Äôs scour the building one more time before we pack it in and get some sleep so we can wake early and plaster the neighborhood with flyers tomorrow. We go down to the basement and the second time I called his name, I hear the sweet cries of my little boy. 

I can‚Äôt even explain how I felt for those 7 hours. Panic, grief, annihilating rage, making all kinds of promises about how I‚Äôm going to change my life, that he‚Äôs the only thing that matters, how I‚Äôm not scared about stupid shit anymore. 

You know, the night my boy actually went missing was literally the first day that I promised myself that I wouldn‚Äôt smoke cigarettes anymore after 14 years. I went without smoking all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday until shit hit the fan. As you can imagine, I smoked my fucking face off.

I was so scared and distracted by so many things in life before this happened. I‚Äôve had R since he was a kitten 6 years ago. I‚Äôve never lost him and never been without him. Nothing scares me anymore because when a part of you dies and then is brought back to life, man, anything literally anything is possible. I‚Äôm done with cigarettes. I‚Äôm not scared of commitment in my relationship now. I‚Äôm ready to take it to the next level. I‚Äôm ready to make the big move out of this state and into the one I‚Äôve been wanting for several years. I don‚Äôt feel bad anymore about setting better boundaries in my work and I feel so much more driven to crush my goals and garner success in my business. 

I don‚Äôt have children. R is my child and it‚Äôs just so crazy that when faced with something like this, your focus on life seems to just clear, like fitting the right lens on a camera. I know what matters now and what doesn‚Äôt. 

For my little boy, well I took him to the vet on Monday and he got two shots updated. I‚Äôm about to bring him again today for bloodwork (he was too anxious to do blood on Monday) and in about a week he will be getting a dental cleaning for the first time and when he‚Äôs under for that, they will put in a microchip.

I like going for walks alone. Sometimes I'll take the camera. Sometimes I'll listen to music. Sometimes I'll just listen to birds, the wind and observe as much as I can and generally enjoy the world. I never know how long I'll do it for or where my legs will take me.

I love doing it alone because it makes me appreciate everything around me and I don't have to consider how fast or slow I walk and I can go anywhere for however long I want to.

For some reason I feel like a weirdo when I do it. I often get self-conscious about how I walk and what I'm looking at. Pretty much no one else seems to be walking by themselves just for the sake of walking. To be fair, I usually do it at a time when most people work or are at school, but here's my experiences:

99% are people with dogs. Those damn people with dogs... Everyone's got a dog and I'm apparently the only sociopath who's there to walk himself. I love how I can stare at the dogs and start smilling before switching to the owner and saying hello. I still hate them for making me feel weird every time I pass them.

Then you have those who leveled up their dogs and are pushing down strollers. Pretty much the same thing but usually slightly less friendly (can't blame them). I can't use the trick of looking at the dog. I assume staring at the stroller wouldn't work as well... They always wear sunglasses, which makes eye contact, or rather lack of one, even weirder. Thanks to my paranoid brain that will make me feel like a pedo under watch. 

Power walkers with headphones on. They do often seem to be there for just for the sake of walking but at the same time they don't seem to be there at all. I used to do this myself until very recently - believe me when I say you have no idea how much you're missing out if you always do that. If I look at them, smile and say ""morning!"" they will somehow manage to spin their head into a fourth dimension.

Joggers. Good going, I won't dare to comment anything negative about that. 

Finally you have pensioners. The group I, a 23 year old guy, somehow have the most in common with. The only regular group I see that seem to be walking for the sake of walking. The only one that doesn't make me feel weird. They're in no rush. Just looking around and ocasionally stopping to admire something.

Of course later on in the day you get couples, parents with kids and groups of friends. 99% of the time with dogs, obviously.

Barely anyone there just for the sake of enjoying being there.

And it makes me feel like a total weirdo. Going to cinema alone, hell, dining alone? Not a problem for me, because I still have a visible reason, objective, whatever. Hiking alone? Same. But going for a regular walk alone? Now that's a next level creepiness :) 

I used to love going for walks in the middle of the night. There's nothing quite like a deserted town at 2.30am on a week night. Now I only do it during the day. 

Do you like to walk? At what times? Alone or with others? If alone, does that make you feel weird? Do you have headphones on or do you rather listen to the sound scape? Do you look around or under your feet? Smile at people and say hello or do you keep to yourself? What do other people do where you live? What groups/types/stereotypes of people do you observe? Do you get self-conscious about the way you're walking?

BTW, I kinda already asked this, but what do you look at when walking around? I will sometimes start thinking about this and won't for the life of me be able to just auto-pilot it. Should I look ahead, at people walking at me, trees on the side?? I wish I could get a some kind of a heat map of what different people look at. Could be very interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

So I noticed that when I go into the shower, it is usually like 2pm.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the entire routine which includes being done with my shower and everything that follows, it is usually 4:30pm...

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a breakdown of the things I do.

&amp;#x200B;

* Shower - upto 30 mins if I space out; which I tend to do a lot of in the shower.
* drying - from 2 mins to 10 mins if I was my huge head of hair too and then have to dry it all...
* brushing my teeth - I always do this after a shower - 1 to 2 mins.
* shaving if I have facial hair - upto 6 mins.
* applying moisturizer or cream to my skin - upto 10 mins.
* getting dressed - upto a minute.
* oiling my hair - this is such a fucker, since I have half African hair that frizzes up like crazy and is insanely hard to maintain. Hairdressers cannot help but comment on the thickness of the strands. I have to do this or I'll have a massive bird's nest on my head. this could take upto 20 mins or more. depends on when I choose to give up.
* perfuming - I am overly obsessed with how I smell, since it is very easy for me to perspire and end up smelling of sweat. I apply a range of perfumes everywhere, especially the hair since my head heats up first. - 5 mins.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I'm finally ready to leave the house! Hooray! Too bad it is 5 - 6 pm and everything is closed cause this is how the UK works. Everything closes before 6.

This wasn't his only quirk. My dad was a bit OC and would arrange decorative rocks in a window where we lived. Nermal quickly figured out if he knocked off the rocks my dad would come outside and sometimes feed him. Those rocks became a signal for food and/or attention for years. Lastly, Nermal was a fighter. He was neutered, but this did not stop him from being the neighborhood bully. Only once did Nermal come home with an injury (nothing major) so I assume he was a pretty good fighter.

I find it difficult to identify with people that talk about the creativity of lyrics, I prefer the musical aspect.\n\nAlthough there are limits and I would notice the redundancy in songs like ""my hump""', 'I like thinking about this because it really highlights the two philosophies people have with music. Some people prefer their music have more analytical value, with structure and specialist complexity, while some people prefer music that is more intuitive, and based more on subjective experience. Obviously it\'s more like a spectrum that people will fall between, but the nature of music identity is that people will tend to move towards a side and stick to it.\n\n\nI have a friend that is pretty polar opposite to me in musical preference, we both like hip-hop,  he likes to highlight the meaning behind the lyricism and structure of the beats, he even points out things like the metre of the beats and downbeats and all that stuff, things I\'m not keen to. I will just point out how I like the choice of certain words in a rapper\'s flow and how it added to the \'melody\' of the verse in general, sometimes we will butt heads because I will say something akin to ""that one stanza was sick!"" and he will rebuttle with ""yeah but it doesn\'t really mean anything."" To him the words in a verse need something solid underneath it to give it value, I simply see the words as having their own merit from the context of the immediate words and sounds around them, as mundane as the underlying message may be. We also both like rock music, but he leans towards prog, math rock, and hardcore and I will lean towards things that sound closer to blues rock, alternative, and jazz fusion. In electronic music, he\'s really keen to dubstep, dnb, and trap, but I focus more on dance, electro, and future bass. \n\nOf course I dont judge him for this discrepancy, if anything his mindset makes his whole taste in music a very calculated curation, whereas I sometimes find myself saying that I like songs because they \'just sound nice to me\' or they convey a \'feeling\'.

I‚Äôve heard as low as 14 if I‚Äôm being honest, but I hear 16 as a guess a lot. Maybe they‚Äôre over-exaggerating when they say I look like a high schooler, but I‚Äôve heard it so much recently and I already knew I looked young for my age.

I started a job as a medical scribe last August, so I see a lot of patients as I write the visit notes for my physician. I‚Äôve gotten used to patients giving me strange looks as I enter the room. Those without filters will just blurt out, ‚ÄúHow old are you? ‚ÄòCause you look like you‚Äôre 16.‚Äù You‚Äôd think common sense would tell them that a 16 year old wouldn‚Äôt be scribing for a doctor at 10 am on a weekday, but go figure I guess.

I go to the gym a lot, I try to dress well, and I‚Äôd grow facial hair if I could. I don‚Äôt exactly have a deep voice but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs high pitched either. I‚Äôd like to think that I present myself as generally smart and mature. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ugly or anything, I just look young. 

Right after I‚Äôm told I look young, I always hear, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll like that when you‚Äôre older‚Äù or ‚Äúbut that‚Äôs a good thing.‚Äù But it certainly doesn‚Äôt feel like a good thing at the moment. Sometimes I feel like that initial impression makes some people treat me like a teenager. I also think it might affect my chances with girls I‚Äôve liked because they might see me as a boy and not a man.

Kind of asking here what I might be able to do to appear older. That being said, I feel like I cover a lot of the methods that would normally be suggested. I‚Äôm prepared to just live with my baby face for a while and hope that it benefits me when I‚Äôm older. I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll look unnatural when I‚Äôm older because I‚Äôll never look my age.

I made this account a few nights ago in anticipation of me writing this, but I think the title speaks for itself. 

TL;DR: had a tough time which I tried to push through, had to admit defeat but now feel a little more hopeful than ever before, don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out and seek therapy as it may exactly what you need! 

Some background: I have been struggling mentally for a few years now, and tackling it with meds which have helped but never cleared it up, but it all came to a head around this time last year when I was let go from my job and my fianc√© left me within a few days.

I told myself I could get over it with no help and pushed on, getting a new job (which I hate but that‚Äôs another story) and trying to get back out into the world. 

However it hasn‚Äôt been so easy and I found myself struggling more than I ever have before, and finding it difficult to confide in friends or family as it‚Äôs a touchy subject. My parents finally convinced me to seek out a therapist and, after much anxiety about the meeting, my first session was last night.

And...it went really well! Obviously it hasn‚Äôt cleared everything up in one fell swoop but it put a lot of my fears to bed about my problems being silly or getting laughed out of the office. I even got some homework away to keep focusing on things that will keep me thinking positive. 

I‚Äôm still nervous but glad I have started this journey, I didn‚Äôt know where else to post this so I hope it isn‚Äôt too out of place, and I hope I can now motivate others to take that step if they‚Äôre thinking about it, it may be the difference.

Some old Dell will do what my MacBook Pro does, and an Xbox plays games far less expensive than a 1500 dollar gaming rig. I could lease a Honda Civic for half the price as my Acura. I completely understand all these things. \n\nOne thing about me, I grew up without much. I remember my first pair of name brand shoes (Nike) was a hand-me-down pair from a friend‚Äôs mother. Yes, I accepted a women‚Äôs pair of shoes, and wore them lol. \n\nWhat you‚Äôre feeling is extremely important, and will aid in your journey to contentment. I feel that money does not bring me happiness, but my loved ones and hobbies do. Money is a way of interacting with my loved ones and learning new things with my hobbies. I am extremely grateful for my life and make enough money for a very solid retirement for my wife and I, and enough cash for a freeing feeling of day to day spending (1$ here, 5$ there type of thing). \n\nBest of luck to you. \n\nCheers', ""OP,I am exactly like that except the traveling part.I mean,I don't wear a watch,I have a simple car and in general,I want things to be as simple as possible.My only devices are a phone and a laptop,which is more of a family computer.Don't you feel more at ease about having less things or less expensive stuff?I mean,everything is simpler and I feel that the less expensive stuff you have,the better!Don't you agree?\n\nEdit:Spelling errors"", 'Tbh I actually reduced my work time from 100% to 70% (I\'m a nurse) cause I figured that I\'m not spending money at all.\n\nWent through the city a year ago but everything I saw I was like: ""Meh... mhh.. maybe.. but nah, my phone is still fine, maybe next year..."" or ""A new TV maybe?

I love going to work at 7 in the morning and leaving at 10 to walk through the park, sit in a cafe or read or whatever.\n\nHeck, even if I travel I don\'t need anything.

People want so much crap in their lives, and I fully believe myself to be content with relatively less and to aim for that.

Which are my laptop and phone. When doing so, I'm also meticulous about it. But at the same time, I want to get it as cheap as I can. Usually, if you wait six months after the phone/gadget came out, you can get it for way less than the retail price. And you can even get them way less if you look around on eBay. Some people would buy stuff, use it for a day, throw it in a drawer, until one day they decide to sell it. \n\nThat's how I got my mom's iPhone SE for only $150 (after a year it came out), and it was pretty much brand spanking new. (the seller I got it from was an Android guy, wanted to try iPhone, but ended up going back, and the said iPhone was thrown into a drawer for seven months).\n\nAlso when I pick up items like phones and laptops. I mainly look for quality, reliability, speed, and battery life. I don't it to fall apart easily (like it would easily bend from just putting it in your pocket or backpack, the screen would shatter from a 1 foot drop, etc..). I don't want it to overheat easily or face any hidden issue (like on a laptop, the hinge may fail prematurely or the flash memory on a phone would slowdown prematurely). I want my stuff to be faster (it doesn't have to be a gaming PC or some behemoth), I shouldn't have to wait a minute for Google Chrome or Microsoft Word to open. Oh and last but not least. I shouldn't have to be tethered to the wall or power bank all day. Or else, what's even the point of making things portable?\n\nOtherwise, for other stuff. I'm not too picky.

First of all, I rarely wear anything on me. That includes jewelry and watches. It just makes me skin irritated. Besides, I can always check the time by either looking at a wall clock, at a computer, or just pull my phone out. As for jewelry, they look nice but after a day or two, it's just another item that I'll get bored with.

I'm not really a car guy either. I just want a car that has the best fuel economy, working A/C, that can get me from A to B, and the availability of parts, in case it doesn't have warranty and I need it to be repaired. 

I could care less for touchscreen radios and built-in GPS. As I can just buy a mount for my phone, and then simply pair it via Bluetooth. Speaking of which, I just want a simple radio but with Bluetooth.

For this, it's one exception. I don't want a big house, especially if I'm the one whose doing the cleaning. I don't want to spend the whole day cleaning. However, I do want a small studio-type apartment or condo in the city. If not, in the city. One that's a suburb that's a walking distance to the bus station or train station, that will take me to the city.

When I was younger, I've always wanted that top of the line MacBook Pro and gaming PC. Then, I realize that I lose interest in games after ten minutes, and that I only use my computer for browsing the web, and typing documents. Now, as long as I have a decent quality laptop that's reliable and fast enough for what I need it to do (web browsing, streaming videos and running Microsoft Office), oh and the battery lasts an entire day, that's all I want from a laptop/computer. Once owned a Dell Precision workstation with 6-core CPU, and 24GB of RAM. Now, I'm typing this on a Dell laptop with a low-powered dual-core CPU with 8GB of RAM and that weighs 3LBs.

Same thing with phones, when I was young, I've always been chasing after the latest iPhone or Samsung. But then I also realize that I only use my phone for social media, listening to music, and camera. No matter how expensive the phone is, I'll always get bored with it after a week. I actually had an iPhone 6S Plus, but due to my needs, I had to ditch it. Now, I'm using a $300 Chinese phone (Xiaomi Pocophone F1), I'm happy with it, and it also serves my needs.

With all that said. The things I'll find myself still indulging at are food, and traveling. We only get to live once, so I'd like to keep tasting good food and go to as much place as I can.

We've already played two gigs and it's awesome, I wouldn't have thought I'd be living out my dream since the start of the year.     
Life is still stressful, but it got harder when school started, with the whole curriculum and stuff changing. But I enrolled in this distance ed maths class, and holy crap was it confusing, hard, stressful and all. The amount of work they give us is crazy! Either way this entire first half of the semester has been messed, I've been trying to catch up on work FROM THE FIRST WEEK &amp; a massive assignment that I have never experienced anything more difficult to work on. Either way, I just spent all of yesterday working on it and finished it and handed it in today.     
Cool thing was, I had to email my teacher to send it to me because I was home, and I forgot my USB, I sent her an email like heaps long and if you read it, it probably looks like I should be in an institution (username checks). Either way, she did the coolest thing and replied within a minute ""Hold on"" and then she sent me the exact files I needed from my usb, I sent her a custom meme outlining how awesome it was. (My school is a special school for kids who need, lets say a ""second chance"").     
EIther way, same thing happened today, -ish. I gained the courage and had a massive revelation that like I should just tell my maths teacher what I was talking to my case manager about (Who just happens to be the teacher I was talking about earlier with the USB thing) and so I said that I am going to hand in all the work I have done and stop trying to catch up so hard and just work on the current work, because the way it's been going has completely impacted my mentality. She said it was fine and that it was great for me to do that, and she even said that she noticed the other day when I told the other kids how to not stress or how I coped with it something like that I forgot but she thought that was cool.

In class i found out we had to attach the photograph with the portrait drawing upon submitting our pieces, and i recall our art teacher telling us right before the bell rang that she'd return it, along with our drawings once she'd given us a grade. Somehow she only returned our individual grades &amp; drawings back a few weeks later, and being the kid who didnt like to question teachers then, i tried not to worry about it. None of us got our pictures back, i was pretty sure she just forgot (i still do today) but i was hoping my art teacher would remember while doing her year end desk clearing and return it on graduation day.

It never happened, and i never got that photo back. I'm not upset about it though really, because i've got the soft copy of it and even one which i printed out a few years back as one of my bedside photos :) but till this day i can't help but sometimes wonder what eventually happened to that photograph or what my teacher did with it in the end.

I'm beginning to think I'm a fair weather skier. They also still have a 97"" base, which is pretty great considering the date.

Also, there was never a single line. I love Monarch, CO!",CasualConversation,50 degrees of bliss,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/b6iyev/50_degrees_of_bliss/

Lately though I've kind of been craving to learn if that makes sense and I've been feeling pretty restless. So I decided to get into Law school and become a prosecutor. I expected my friends and family to tell me that it's way too hard for me and to pick something else.

I had the nicest surprise ever! Both of my friends congratulated me for finally making a decision and told me that they know I'll manage to do whatever I want to do. They said I'm smart and they trust me! My sisters were so happy and said they'll try to support me as much as they can! They said they don't have a single doubt about my decision!!

It might seem overbearing to some but to me this means the world. I can't believe I'm finally surrounded by supportive people who just truly want the best for me. It was one of my dreams to have this when I was younger and I can't believe I'm this freaking lucky to finally have it. Things like this always brings my self esteem up and make me believe in myself. I can't wait to start college, study my ass off and make these people proud of me.

I've never been diagnosed with any mental disorders.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting my last birthday, I haven't been really excited about them. This year was no exception. I should be way more hyped up, you know? It's my birthday! It's my day! I'm almost 18, and it's an exciting new world! Right? For me, not really. The whole premise of the day seems melancholy to me. I think it's because the idea of *designated happiness* of sorts really turns me off. It does the opposite for me. Last night I stayed up not long after midnight, and one of my friends texted me all excited, wishing me a happy birthday, etc. and I didn't really enjoy it. It depressed me to say that I wasn't doing anything exciting for it. I just put on my best happy face and tried to reply to everything she said with a decent level of enthusiasm.

&amp;#x200B;

In reality, that took everything out of me. It was like a punch to the gut. For no discernible reason, I felt an overwhelming urge simply to *die.* I just... I didn't want to be here anymore. I suddenly wished I was dead, for no reason. My life isn't particularly bad or perfect at all, I don't suffer from any mental illness as far as I know, but I just began having really suicidal thoughts. I went to sleep soon after, to skip to the next day, to try and get it all over with.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, my mother woke me up with a ""Happy Birthday!"" and she was really excited. She asked me if I had any plans, and I told her that I would probably stay in for the day, just to relax. And the thoughts came back.

&amp;#x200B;

I began doing my day-to-day, despite not having much motivation to do anything, and not long after, I received a text from my best friend, a girl called Kaylee.

&amp;#x200B;

""Happy Birthday!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

""Thanks,"" I replied. She asked if I had any plans, to which I said no.

&amp;#x200B;

""We're hanging out, I'll be there in 15 minutes,"" she said. With this girl, there isn't any telling her no. And I won't lie, I actually was excited to spend time with her. She's a person I really trust, and I can open up to her about things like what's happening to me. It doesn't happen often, so it's quite the anomaly for me, and I have no idea how to handle it otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

She arrived after not too long, and I got in her car, and we left. She's a bit older, and has her license and a car.

&amp;#x200B;

""Where are we going?"" I asked.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, I don't know where we're *going,* but I know what we're *doing,""* she said.

&amp;#x200B;

""What are we doing then?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

""Where do you want to eat?"" She countered. I smiled and shook my head, before looking up at her and suggesting one of my favorite restaurants. From there, she took me out to eat, and generally spent time with me from there. I didn't have anything else planned, so I had the whole day with her. We just did simple things, like driving around aimlessly (we live in a small town, it's all we have to do for fun) hanging out around her house for a bit, swinging by the beach, running an errand or two, then just sitting in a parking lot and talking about current events, how her relationship is going, our philosophies on different topics, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Really trivial stuff, but I'll be damned if it didn't fill me with love. Hanging out with her just completely filled my emotional battery. I feel whole. I feel totally down to Earth again. We hung out for about 8 hours before my curfew was almost up and she dropped me off at home. I just caught myself thinking how lucky I am to have a friend like that, who goes out of her way to spend time with me. I needed to share it with someone. I never got a chance to open up to her about what I was feeling, because by then it had just gone. I didn't feel that way anymore at all. I feel great. I feel refreshed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing this now to all best friends everywhere, that you are the best kind of person, and I love you. You're sometimes just what we need to feel better again, even if you don't even know something is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to keep the wholesome train going, so does anyone else want to tell about an experience where their friend helped out as much as Kaylee did here?

There's this guy that used to work for me 20 years ago, and it's kind of weird, he will call me once a year or so to say hi and almost without fail, it happens a few days after I have been thinking about him, wondering what he is up to.  It's one of those things that I've noticed, but haven't really given much thought to.  It just kind of happens with him.

So last week I was listening to a podcast about paranormal topics and how we are all connected and  I started thinking; ""I wish I could know for sure if this stuff is true.  How can I test it?""  And this guy came to mind.  So I thought, I wonder if I can make this happen again if I start thinking about him?  So I started thinking about him really hard, and I even said his name out loud and wrote it down a few times:  TOM WOODHALL (not his real name).  I did this for two days and nothing happened, and I thought ""well, what did you expect?"" and forgot about it.  But today, he texted me while I was at work and asked if I wanted to have lunch sometime.   It has literally been about a year and a half since I've heard from him, and here he is texting me just a few days after I tried this experiment.

But it get's better....

This morning (same day), before I left for work, I pulled out some insurance papers from my file cabinet and took them to work because I was going to call my agent.  When I got home tonight I went to put the papers back in the hanging folder that I had left out on the table. I picked up the folder and my jaw dropped.  The label on the hanging folder said TOM WOODHALL.   I looked at it...stunned...wtf?   I flipped the folder over...it said INSURANCE on the other side.  It was an old folder from 20 years ago at work that I had re-used by flipping the label around.

So that was a lot more than I expected.  Not life changing, but seems like more than could be explained by coincidence, especially the folder.  No idea what it means, but now I have to decide whether I should mention all of this to him at lunch tomorrow or not.

You decide who you really want to spend time with, how you want to pass your weekend, what music to listen to, how to dress, what hobbies to choose. It's the time where the peer pressure starts wearing off and you realize all the worries about how you are perceived are in your head.

So named because it's not actual social interaction and not actual people, but still gives me a sort of odd, distant sense of being involved in something, of having friends and connections and knowing people. It's not satisfying, in the end, but it's certainly better than nothing.

I was thinking today, as I updated a bookmark to where I was reading, that if I'm so desiring of social interaction and can access it, even vicariously, through reading...why don't I write my own? I can create characters, develop interactions and relationships, and explore the consequences of an action or situation. I've done it for every script and story I've ever written - that's what writing *is* to me.

And I realized, the answer is in the unknown. The reason webcomics are a vicarious social interaction is that just like real people, I can have an idea of what is happening or what will happen, but how they'll react isn't actually certain. With my own writing, it's rare if ever this happens. More often, the characters end up sounding more and more like me, no matter how differently I try to make them in the beginning.

So, I can't really remember what happened before this, all except a dream where this trans girl in my class kissed me on the cheek, but...

I was in a metallic, dark-silver Honda. Not sure how I know it was a Honda -- it was a weird ass convertible model. The back looked like a Lamborghini. I can't remember what the front really looked like. It was my car; again, not sure how since I don't have any money.

I was in a parking lot, heading out to the road when I had my headphones on listening to Killshot by Eminem. It was either Killshot or Medicated by Wiz Khalifa, 'cause those were the last two songs I listened to last night.

I knew I wasn't supposed to wear headphones while driving, so I unplugged them to listen to my music on the radio. I was flipping through the radio stations when I noticed I was about to drive off a hill (the road I was turning on to was beside a rather steep hill). I slam the brakes, but my genius mind remembers my dad's advice on not slamming the brakes (I'm currently learning how to drive in real life, so that's why that popped into my head), so I let off the brake and slam onto it, realizing that was a stupid idea.

It was too late, though. The car tipped over the hill and began its downward descent.

Me being the absolute Einstein prodigy I am, I don't keep my foot on the brakes. No no. I hop out of the car and grab onto the door, hoping I could pull it back up. It obviously just plops out of my hand, and all I could do was watch as my baby drifted down the grass hill and onto the road below. When it landed onto the road, it didn't look like too much damage was done.

That was until some asshole in a red SUV collided into my vehicle, causing both cars to go aflame and soon erupt into explosions.

At this point, I was freaking out. I knew my grandparents (whom I currently live with) would kill me. I also, for some reason, lost my phone in the grass during the chaos, so I was looking around for that. I was actually having a panic attack.

I'm applying to graduate programs. I wasn't as on top of the applications,  as I should have been and my parents yelled at me for being irresponsible and being stupid with the process. It makes sense, the deadlines are coming up, and my family wants the best for me. They don't want me to mess this up. After a while, I realized a lot of the things (letter of recs) aren't in my control, and when I tried to explain it, they got even angrier. 

I decided to go home, sit in bed all day and cry. I told my boyfriend what was going on, but I didn't want to burden him. I canceled all my plans and I couldn't stop crying.

I couldn't work on any applications so I just watched youtube and slept all day. I basically starved myself because I didn't want to leave my room. 

I was pretty low. It probably doesn't make any sense, on why I was so sad, but it hit a nerve, I try so hard and it felt inevitable for me to miss a few things. 

I decided I needed to vent everything. I didn't want to burden my friends or boyfriend, even though i knew they would be there for me. I just didn't want to reach out to them. I didn't want advice or criticism or fake ""you're doing okay"" talks.

I decided to write in my journal. I hadn't written in it in months.  I was crying for most of it. I just wrote everything that bothered me. Everything I was worried about, everything in my control that I could do, and everything outside of my control. I wrote everything that I loved right now and what I was happy about. I wrote for almost 2 hours just reflecting.

I realized that the fights i had today seemed so big and uncontrollable, but they weren't. I went through worse things, and I've accomplished better. Tomorrow I can fix the things that I can, and while today sucked, I still have time to fix them. This morning, everything seemed so impossible.

Maybe this sounds so lame and cheesey, and maybe it is, but i don't really care. I was having a bad day. And while it still is relatively a bad day, I feel okay now. I feel able to leave my bed. And that is honestly all i was hoping for today.

It sounds stupid, because I literally did nothing, but I feel accomplished.

I took control of a shitty situation and bad emotions leaking out of me, and I fixed it. I feel okay and slightly positive. And for someone that struggled with depression, I'm really proud that I was able to find an outlet that allowed me to be okay so quickly.

Now the zoo is AZA-accredited, they're cleaning enclosures regularly so this isn't some ""hoarders"" situation, don't want anyone getting the wrong idea...but some of these animals just reallllly stink...cleaning the cheetah nighthouse in the morning smells like a cat litterbox times 100, except with no odor-reducing litter.  Cleaning up after sea lions and seals is even worse, my goodness. Even their breath is godawful, like halitosis mixed with hot humid spoiled fish, and you can smell it from ten feet away when one belches. Their droppings are even fouler...

I also got fox urine on my hand while cleaning the fox enclosure on my second day, and tried to wash it off but the smell wouldn't leave, I could smell it all day and could even smell it after I showered at night. I asked another keeper about it and she just laughed and said ""Oh, yep, foxes mark territory with urine, water's not supposed to remove it!"" Like this was just normal! How are these people okay with just being stinky like that?

I've gotten written up twice already for doing terrible jobs cleaning enclosures because I've been trying to do it as fast as possible to avoid puking. I've tried to force myself to but I just can't. I thought it would be like cleaning up after dogs and cats but bigger, but...it's really not. I'll probably get fired any day now...

I wasn't eating well at all, my studies are in a state of decline, I just haven't been looking after myself.

It's not an all-or-nothing game here, learning some programming will make you better at a lot of logical and critical thinking tasks, will allow you to better understand the tools that you use every day (reddit), and can just be plain old fun. You don't have to dive in far enough to get a job, it's enough to dip your feet in to understand if it's a viable career choice for you and I think you'll learn enough along the way to be of value even if your conclusion is that it's not for you.\n\nThere are a lot of entry points into the field and which you pick doesn't really matter a ton. If you'd like to build websites or are a visual person, maybe start with HTML/CSS and progress on to Javascript.

If you are into game design maybe pick up Unity/C# and move in that direction.

So here's my advice in regards to Goals.\n\nKeep track of things. (Literally, KEEP TRACK OF THINGS) Also, set goals for yourself.\n\nThe reason I say keep track of things is because it allows you to be familiar with your own situation. This is really important because it helps you identify your flaws, things you need to change, and goals you need to set for yourself. Additionally, you may think you know your flaws and what goals you need to set, but do you ~really~ know them? When you start keeping track of things, you will see things about yourself that you wouldn't otherwise see. \n\nFor example: I make three sets of goals for myself - a one week goal, a quarterly goal, and an annual goal. (I don't like to plan more than a year ahead because things tend to change.)\n\nOne week goal: this is just 3 - 4 general things I want to have accomplished by the end of the upcoming week. I also elaborate on these goals to create a weekly outline. e.g. on Monday I will do x, y, z. \n\nQuarterly goals: These are again 3 - 4 general goals for the next quarter. I also include one or two things I want done for each week. \n\nAnnual goals: I do this slightly differently than the other goals. I write this like a company's mission statement. e.g. my goal is to (x,) And I will do this by accomplishing (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h.) I will have a and b done by quarter 1. I will have c and d done by quarter 2 ...\n\n\nThese don't necessarily have to be academic, or financial goals either. They can just be emotional or social goals.\n\nPersonally, keeping track of things and setting goals usually helps me the most. I hope this helps.

Lately I've been feeling really self conscious and wondering if I should try to wear contacts sometime because I wonder if I might look better that way. This post just made me even more self conscious about it lol. I don't know if it's something cultural, like there's still some feeling of people look nerdier with glasses even though it feels like it's considered a lot more normal nowadays. I don't think it would have to do with eye contact as when people check you out they're not necessarily making eye contact, more looking you over I think"", ""Oh definitely. I have quite unusual eyes (which is a good thing because they don't work worth a damn) and ever since I was a little girl, people have stopped me on the street to comment on them, practically on a daily basis.\n\nNow that I live in a country where my eye color and shape is extremely rare, I get even more comments, especially when I wear makeup, to the point where it's easily five or six comments from strangers when I just run out to do groceries. People are very rarely weird about it, but it does get tiring. (And yes, I realize that's a nice problem to have, but still)\n\nIn the past few months I've started to wear my thick glasses and no eye makeup. I still get comments, but not nearly as many and it's *wonderful*.

I\'ve been wearing glasses since I was 10 and then on and off with contacts around 16(these days I wear my glasses more often, 5/7 days/week).  I used to be self-conscious too about them, but I think the trick for me was getting a pair of glasses that looked more flattering for me (although someone once commented that they are ""pornstar"" glasses...). At the end of the day, prescription glasses aren\'t about the aesthetic, even though it has turned into that somewhat (there are people who wear glasses with no prescription just for the look!). And my pornstar comment should tell you that people do find glasses attractive. I just noticed that for me, the attention lessens - but doesn\'t diminish to zero. I feel like glasses sometimes hide our natural features, like eye shape or can sometimes distort them (I love my glasses despite them making my eyes look smaller than they actually are... but some people have the opposite problem). If you\'re debating getting contacts, you could always try them out. Best case, you\'ll love them and worst case, you don\'t. There\'s not a ton to lose (except some money of course). Every optometrist\'s office I\'ve been to have provided patients with a trial pair to see if that brand was a good fit or not.

I know that's a stupid answer. Of course the country was established way before that lmao. The 7 and the 8 were mixed up in my head when I was thinking of American independence.

Then they asked me about the 2020 election. I didn't want to give them ammo for a Youtube video about my political beliefs (""stupid college kids""), so I lied and pretended that I supported different 2020 candidates. That way at least my stupidity would work for me.

Well I just wanted to share this story. Maybe if I see myself on Youtube, I can point back to this post and say ""SEE? I said 1783 but they cut it out!"". Maybe I'll be able to call them out on misleading edits if that ever happens.

I never got their names or their Youtube channel so that might never happen.

I‚Äôve gotten a fair amount accomplished since I made the decision, but I would love real world experience and advice about what I can look out for and expect as I go through this. I‚Äôve never moved anywhere except to the house I purchased, and that was close to my hometown, so this is a big leap for me. 

Some key facts:

- I am not on a time crunch - my timeline right now is June-July, but that‚Äôs dependent on a few things and not set in stone. 
- I have ample job opportunities and have already lined up a temporary position which will result in a pay increase from my current situation. I have a lot of flexibility with this given my profession, so employment is not a concern on any level for me. 
- I have plans for renting my house out with a relatively easy transition; at present, I have roommates. When I leave they will be signing a lease for a year and covering the full cost of mortgage/utilities. 
- I am currently working on decluttering, and trying not to get too overwhelmed with all of the ‚Äúthings‚Äù I‚Äôve acquired. So far I‚Äôve gotten rid of a few boxes of books and several bags of clothing - my plan is to eventually host a yard sale or estate sale of sorts, and keep giving away as much as I can in the interim. I am subscribed to r/decluttering and am very much employing the ‚Äújoy spark‚Äù method with anything I come into contact in during my daily activities (i.e., if I see something in my drawer that I know logically hasn‚Äôt been put to use, it gets tossed in the trash or donate piles). I‚Äôm trying to remove at *least* a box a week of things to donate before I get into the big packing. 

Questions:
- How did you prioritize what stayed and what went? Did you find the things you put into storage ever held value or use for you after the fact? How did you maintain a sense of sentimentality without physically holding on to every little thing that ever held meaning to you? 
- Did you use a moving company? What did it cost for how far you had to move? Was it worth it? Have you packed and moved your one things successfully?
- What questions should I ask looking for a place to rent? What experiences have you had with apartment complexes and what would you suggest to avoid discord and difficulties in living in an apartment building? Top floor or bottom? 
- Have you ever rented out your home? How did it work for you? What was your experience with your renters?

I‚Äôm sure there is plenty I‚Äôm forgetting and I‚Äôm keeping a spreadsheet of different things I need to accomplish as well as answers to questions I‚Äôve asked of professionals in the process. Happy also to take suggestions of where else to post if you have them (I searched ‚Äúmoving‚Äù and it wasn‚Äôt explicitly helpful - but will accept links, subreddits, whatever you guys have!!!)

In my state, you have to be about a year in to the school before you can apply for an apprenticeship, and it's a 2-year college degree. Our state is a dual license, where you get licensed to be both a funeral director AND a mortician. I worked with a trade mortician, and though it wasn't legal for me to do so, he did let me be his unofficial apprentice. I washed hair and face, shaved face, painted nails and did some makeup application to the arms and hands, helped with dressing and casketing. I also helped suture/sew bodies back up if they were a post-autopsy. I worked supervising viewings and answer the phone in the evenings. I preferred the mortician duties over the funeral stuff though, and also at night I would go with the funeral director to pick up the deceased where ever they were.

Though this was 12 years ago, at the time, it was still very male dominant industry.  The funeral industry, at the time, was very particular and rigid when it comes to tradition and perfectionism. At one of the funeral homes, I was overlooked for a funeral assistant position and I knew it was because I was not a man. (For the record, I'm not one to ever think that way in general but it was pretty blatantly obvious.)  In the two funeral homes I worked in, they were run by family, and, family tends to fight, and have drama behind the scenes. This would tend to spill over onto us non-family/employees, often putting us in the middle especially if there was a power battle between family members who want to make the decisions and don't agree.

One of the best ways you and your boyfriend may be able to help this guy is getting him to enroll in the VA.  Often many vets are hesitant to going to the VA because they‚Äôve tried before and there appointments seem to be scheduled weeks out, and if they‚Äôre homeless that can seem like eternity.\n\nOn of the quickest ways around this is to check into the psych ward.

In the ward you get a bed, and three meals a day, and a physician and psychiatrist and nurses to check on you daily.  I went in for bipolar, but a lot of vets were in there for PTSD to drug addiction.\n\nThe other benefits to this are they assign you a social worker, and you see them more frequently since they can just come right to you.  They will know more about the homeless vet programs, how to put in disability claims for PTSD and the like, education programs, and there are even programs to help vets find jobs.  The VA can be a bureaucratic nightmare when trying to traverse it by oneself, but in my experience, the social workers really do care and try their best to help vets navigate that. \n\nIf you‚Äôre not American, the system may be different but there are probably similar programs in your country.

&amp;#x200B;

So, despite me having had this account now for a couple of months, I haven't really used it for anything other than memes, and mostly only browsing r/memes.

But as I spend more time here, I'm slowly starting to see the vast amounts of threads on different topics, and forums to engage in.

My question for the veterans (or the somewhat experienced): 

How do you use Reddit on the daily?

What are some of the things that took you personally a while to know how to use properly, or something you didn't even know existed on Reddit at first?

What are some good subreddits/users to subscribe to?

Best way to get karma?

Some cool things to do on here, that might not be obvious to the new users, such as myself.

Like, in your case you walked for a very long time pretty much 180 degrees in the wrong direction. If you had even checked once every 15 minutes where you were on the GPS you would have known you were heading away from the parking area.\n\nFollowing a flat GPS map can get you into trouble too, particularly if the area has multiple trail splits that go around mountain ranges.

it was our first time visiting this mountain in our town, and it was the warmest day we‚Äôve had this year so far (we live on the east coast) so naturally we went out in our light jackets with our gatorades expecting to take a 1-2 hour stroll up to the summit of this mountain (takes an hour up and an hour down) but it had many trails. on the way up we followed pink and it felt very long, and the map showed that grey turned into yellow and it would be a shortcut. it was already 5:30 and it gets dark around 7 so we thought it was our best bet. we were wrong as fuck.

first of all, terrain of yellow was vastly different. we went from walking through trails to scaling up rocks at one point. being afraid of heights I couldn‚Äôt look down, I could only make it up and over. every time we would come over a hill we expected to find the trail leading us out and to the parking lot, but that trail never came. instead, yellow lead to blue. there happened to be another map posted that said ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù and we tried to follow the paths out, to get back to yellow and back to the parking lot. to get there we had to continue to follow the blue path.

we traveled down this path for hours. my phone had 70% battery at this point, and we were watching the sun set fast. but we had hoped that soon we would reach yellow, then white which lead to the parking lot. the problem was that we came to a tree marked with red paint. and various others. we had thought to take a picture of the map and looked for red just to find it all the way on the other side. we had walked so far that we were in a different town, and I was starting to freak out.

I very frequently browse r/UnresolvedMysteries and the lost in the woods ones are by far the most terrifying to me. combine that with my fear of the dark and you have a 20 year old girl crying and hyperventilating with no idea where she is or how to get out. all we could do is continue following markers. my amazing boyfriend lead the way with his bravery and concern for me, telling me constantly we‚Äôd get through this. he was my rock when I truly believed we‚Äôd never get out. that feeling was tripled when we stopped seeing red markers.

it was becoming hard to see anything. we had finally decided (albeit too late) to call for help. the police were amazing and immediately were able to find us. my phone was at 63% now (thank god that I had charged it that morning) and they told me they were hanging up to save the battery, as it was our only flashlight and way of contact. my boyfriend had left his at home. our directions were to stay put and wait for the fire department to call us back.

they called within 10 minutes and were already there within 20. they asked me to hang up and call them back when we hear their ATVs. me and my boyfriend sat in dead silence waiting to hear them, and i‚Äôve never been happier to hear their sirens and see the lights flashing. we were instructed to walk towards them while staying on the phone. when we got to them I felt an instant relief as we walked to the ATV and climbed in. the firefighters were nice and understanding and even cracked some jokes with us. they brought us to a clearing where there were cop cars and firetrucks waiting, and a very nice cop brought us back to our car.

So if you eat at a caloric deficit of 500 Cal/day, you'll lose a kg, or 1.1 lbs, a week. If your target weight is 155 lbs (which would be the 'healthy weight' limit on the BMI scale), you'd have to keep that up for 42 weeks, or about 10 months. You can estimate your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) online, then subtract 500 (or more if you want to lose weight faster, but more than 1000 might not be so healthy), and that's your target caloric intake. Then you can track how much you're eating with MyFitnessPal or a similar app. It's dead simple honestly.\n\nThe reason I'm saying all this is because many people end up falling off the weight loss wagon because they start eating completely differently, e.g. using keto or paleo, and this winds up being too hard to keep up. Or they might follow one of these diets until they meet their goals, but then start eating the way they used to afterwards and gain their weight back quickly. By counting calories, you can keep your diet largely the same, but just... eat less of everything. Obviously, if your diet consists largely of junk food, it's probably best to change it around anyways, but you don't have to eat keto/paleo/whatever to lose weight.\n\nAnecdotally, my father has tried various diets over the years, and nothing got him below a certain threshold weight. Back in September I recommended CICO to him, and he's been steadily losing weight ever since, beating that plateau by a mile.\n\nGood luck, you can do it! Losing weight isn't as complicated as people often make it out to be. It's difficult, to be sure, but in the end it comes down to simple math. You just have to be consistent about it.""]",7,"['Legitimate jealous. Enjoy', ""Wow, thank you very much for your input!

I actually followed through. For once I actually did it. I made progress to making myself better. It wasn't easy by any definition of the word though. I went through my mom's old workout DVDS and found a set of P90X3 that we used to do together. I flipped through them until I found one that I thought I could do (I picked MMX, a workout routine that uses self defense to work muscles) and played it on my computer. I wasn't anywhere near as good as I was when I used to do it, but that's expected. At the end I was proud of myself, even though I modified the routine by doing squats instead of sprawls. I did mess up my left thigh a bit though, I think I hyperextended it a bit. If I can keep what I did up, this is going to be tough, but I'll push through it and hopefully I'll be the best New Me that I can be on the other side.

You can keep the plastics and it should do the same thing, although I hate tripping over multiple plastic bags.\n\nPlan what you‚Äôre putting down in the bagging area first, heavy items, things that you can use as a base to stack items on. You‚Äôre playing checkout Tetris now. Big items like bags of rice, use the ‚ÄúSkip Bagging‚Äù option, toilet paper bundles, paper towels, ect. You can only use skip bagging X amount of times so keep that in mind. \n\nPlan for alcohol. Self checkout hates alcohol purchases, save that for LAST! An attendant will have to clear your purchase. \n\nWhen self checking....scan, place item in bagging area, wait for the light to be green before continuing. Also, know what the produce codes are for your most frequent fruit and veg purchases. This is usually on the sticker most fruits have. Like bananas 4011, vine ripe tomatoes 4047. Place the item on the scale, input the PLU, wait a second and then remove it. (I can‚Äôt tell you the number of people I‚Äôve helped with this.) Learn how to navigate the ‚Äúlook item up‚Äù system.

If it persists, see if it scanned. If yes, just place it off to the side and continue. If it won‚Äôt let you go on, call the attendant.\n\nNow the thing that irritates me is when they don‚Äôt have an attendant or there is only one and the self checkout is packed.

I recently heard news of a college in the US that has officially began a varsity Esports program (dont ask me which one I lost the article ;-;) and the concept really caught my interest.
Now kids are, apparently, beginning to recieve really recognition and scholastic support for... well, playing videogames. In hindsight, it seems kind of unfair that kids who play, lets say football, for fun are encouraged and praised for their hardwork and dedication (and recieve scholarships!) for practicing and improving at it- meanwhile a gamer who does the same thing is scrutinized and discouraged for wasting time. 

What makes physical sports different than digital ones? 

Perhaps times are indeed changing. I mean traditionally, only one of the following was respected and commanded an audience thus having the opportunity to make money via entertainment. However, in newer times  videogames are slowly doing the same thing.

Anyway, I was curious what the people of reddit thought. Do you think our grandchildren are going to be playing on their highschool gaming teams, or is this all just a gimmick? And, do you think this is a good thing?

Some context: 
Today was supposed to be the first day of school after a one week vacation for spring break. My English teacher (who is known to be unreasonably strict and condescending) gave us a research paper that was due today. I tend to be a very busy person and I have several projects and a business I'm working on outside of school. For me, time is very limited. I decided to spend the first 7 days of break on my personal projects and business and reserve the last 3 days for the research paper... Which ended up being not enough time.

As the title and context says, I skipped school. And I feel terrible about it. I feel like I could have done more to get my research paper done on time but I just didn't have the time. Additionally, it's really important that I get a good grade on the paper because last quarter, I got my first B and I really need this quarter to cancel out that B. (I believe it was unreasonable that I got that B. I made one mistake on the citations that ran through the whole paper. She took off points for each one.) 

So right now, I'm at the point where my paper is mostly done. I just need to refine it and make sure everything is correct. Regardless of this, I'm worried that (to my teachers) it would reflect negatively on me as a student for skipping school.

I have since deleted it and starting fresh with a new account. And I‚Äôm sure I still have much to learn. But it feels like cool milestone. Like I‚Äôm taking off some training wheels.

My first was the Nintendo DSi, which started my love of Nintendo games and consoles.  My sister and I each had a DSi, and we would sit right beside the wall separating our rooms and talk over PictoChat whenever we had the chance, and any games I wanted, I made sure were local connection multiplayer compatible, so me and my sister could play together whenever we got a chance. My favorite game on the DSi had to be New Super Mario Bros. I simply LOVED that game, and the fact that it was my first DSi game,  the fact that it had a plethora of mini games and my sister and I could play made it all the more my favorite DSi game. Sadly, I lost it on a trip to Washington D.C.

My second was a Nintendo 3DS XL (The original, not the ""New"" 3DS) and I loved that one, but not as much as my original DSi. I got it for my birthday a year after I lost my DSi, and along with it I got New Super Mario Bros 2, and Mario Kart 7, which I enjoyed both tremendously (I have a Wii, and I played Mario Kart Wii all the time, and still do using CTGP and Wiimmfi) and it opened up my gaming experience to a wider view of games (I got Fire Emblem games, Picross games, Steeldiver: Sub Wars, and others) and I really enjoyed it. I gave this system to my younger sister when I got my current 3DS (The ""New"" version)

I've had my current 3DS since 2015, where I got it at a Texas Roadhouse 5 days before my birthday as a special present (It's been a family tradition in my family to go to Texas Roadhouse before or on our birthday to celebrate) and I have enjoyed as much, if not more than my DSi. My first game I really got and enjoyed was Monster Hunter: Generations (2016) and I instantly fell in love with the game and the series as a whole.

On the board is a month long project wherein students take a Polaroid picture, tack it to a piece of paper, and on that paper they describe attributes about them (i.e. friend, food lover, perfectionist, etc.) it allows you to go as deep or as narrow as you want.

Anyways, I was walking through the student hub, it‚Äôs about 11:00pm, on my way home and decided to read how some people describe themselves. As I was combing through, I look up on the top left of the board and low and behold, one of my best friends took part in the project.

All of his bullet points described him well. But the last one made me smile and super stoked for sure reason. His last one said, ‚ÄúFuture doctor.‚Äù

Now this guy has been through a lot, most recently going through a pretty bad injury that made him have to leave school for a bit. It was definitely hard to see him on his worst days knowing that you can‚Äôt do much to help, but looking at him now, I can see how much he‚Äôs bounced back and used this experience to fuel his fire.

I could talk so much good about this guy, but to sum him up he‚Äôs a friend to all; he just gets people and everyone he meets instantly likes him. At the same time, however, he has such a leveled head and a calm demeanor about himself. He knows how to balance him priorities and make decisions for himself when needed.

My favorite thing about this dude tho, is his heart. He definitely cares about the people in his life and is very outward about it. I feel very lucky to call this guy one of my best friends. 

Anyways, just seeing this, I know he‚Äôll make a great doctor one day, and seeing this definitely made my day. He‚Äôs sacrificed so much, but I‚Äôm stoked to see him realize his dreams, and can‚Äôt wait to see him change the world one day.

Have you had moments that bring you back the people in your life?

I got my then girlfriend a cat about twelve years ago.  We couldn't afford to get her spayed, and she got out one night when she was on heat.   Yes, I know this was our fault.

Anyway, we gave away two of her kittens and kept one.  That was about eleven years ago.  One of the kittens went to my grandmother.  She needed to go into a nursing home three years ago, so now I have three cats.

My grandmother was a witch.  I'm not being facetious, if she were around a few hundred years ago, she would have been a witch.  Herb lore (she got roses growing on what was essentially bed rock within a few years), and she had a familiar - her cats.

Although she could look after herself, she wasn't very active when she got our kitten.  She just *had* to have the black one, and named him 'Pitch'.  There was already two cats in her house, so the kitten didn't get much attention.  He wasn't neglected, just the bottom of the kitty pecking order.

Anyway, after bringing Pitch to our place, he's latched onto me as his favourite human.  My schizophrenic cousin may or may not have tried to take Pitch back to his farm.  It's not clear, and we haven't been able to make contact with my cousin since.  Pitch turned up at my empty grandmother's place very thin and very hungry.

The mother and brother are constantly fighting him, but there's an uneasy truce at the moment.

We went away last weekend for a friend's wedding.  My nephew fed the cats on the Friday and Saturday, but we didn't get home until well after the cat's feeding time on Sunday.  

The grumpy cats were given extra food for us being so neglectful in being a few hours late for feeding.  What horrible pet owners we are!!!

Pitch was no where to be seen.  He's usually the one hanging around reminding us that his food bowl is empty.  I wasn't too worried, and thankfully he came in about an hour later.

He's a very vocal cat.  He meowed at us, but food took precedence.  

This is the first time I've ever heard a cat meow around mouthfuls of food.

Meo-nom-nom-eowww-nom-nom-nom  was the call.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm a freshman at a state university. I absolutely despise it. The monotony, the rules, the time drain that it has become. I don't talk to anyone because I quite literally don't have time to talk to anyone. My brilliant mind decided that going hard with 3 hard classes and 1 easy one two semesters straight would be smart (which wasn't. I did absolutely terrible last semester and I didn't learn my lesson). I feel out of place with the people around me, like everyone has someone, or something to look towards to comfort them. I have nothing. No friends, no romantic interest, my sibling and I are beefing, my cousins and I are beefing, my parents are loving and great people but for a while they've suspected me of having a mental health issue. I can't say I blame them, I agree with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, summertime, when I have complete freedom, I feel at ease. I feel happier, I look happier, girls will talk to me, I actually feel at ease with approaching someone and talking to someone. I have freedom to explore hobbies and interests that I like. I tried (and failed) to make an electric power glove with my dad. It ended with my skateboard on fire at the end, but I still had fun! I learned how to program a poker game. I took up an interest in playing guitar and piano. I was going to the gym more often. I considered it a big accomplishment when my anxious ass self actually had a group of solid friends for the summer to do things with and go places. Us three dudes and four girls traveled around Oregon and Washington, playing our instruments and smoking pot, jumping in the lake, exploring buildings, etc. If there were vacations that others had to go to, we would hang but not as a group leaving me with time to develop my music and programming skills, my biggest interests at the time. I guess what I'm trying to say is I **ALWAYS** had something to do, and it was far out of my comfort zone at times, but it was stuff I enjoyed doing, and I would say it was valuable to **me.**

&amp;#x200B;

At school I just feel trapped. My entire personality shifted to wartime level productivity since my major (Computer Science) is so demanding. It's not just because it's hard, it's because I hate the rules and the forced schedules and assignments and classes that we know we don't need, but so we can say on a paper that we put up with a bunch of bullshit. For me, only reason I'm even in Computer Science is to make my traditional style parents proud. I am their only kid, and we are immigrants, so I feel like if I fuck up that's kind of it. I ruined the bloodline, it ends with me being a giant fuck up to them, and I love my parents so I don't want to do that. At the same time, I feel that my fate is trapped by me pandering to their vision of what their ""perfect son"" would be like. At some point, I know i'll have to face the truth that this is not what I want to do. I just feel so lost and trapped and unable to pursue what I want, I'm not sure what I want. I guess I just want more time to figure myself out. To have good times. To live life like a teenager. I missed out on a majority of that, had two decent summers with great people, and now I'm back to being depressed and anxious and lonely and without hobbies doing something I don't want to do. Difference is, in high school I would be pulling A's.

Look, that is the beauty of it, you might fall, it sounds cliche, but you have to be able to get back up again. Come on people. Also, don't let little things bother you.

Don't let people break you, or you will become weak and you will be more likely to be overcome by stress, discouragement, and peer pressure. God made us all strong!

Not as much as I will know when I am say, 50, but I know that if I don't live life now, the times will pass me by. Same for you. We aren't young forever. Live everyday as if it were your last, that is what I do. I also never look back on choices. Sure I may reflect of past mistakes, but that is just so I can make sure I am the man I want to be tomorrow. Don't be scared of life. I am young, but I knew people that were just as old as me who have been killed. 15 as well, they had all the same dreams and ideas, life goals, same amount of inexperience, same amount of (as my parents call it) 'jackassery'.

You never think it can happen to you, but when you see that, so young, and all of the things they had to offer to the world and it is all just gone like that. It is tough. It really hits you. It makes you think. Live life people, and don't be scared to live. Don't let the little things get to you. If you think the world is bad, be the one to make a difference. If you are upset about something, fix it. If you want to do something in life, get out there and do it. Time doesn't wait around for ever. And neither does chances. Thank you for your time.

ORIGINAL POST:

I work a second job as an RN in an OB-GYN clinic and a woman (late 20s) came in at 1:00pm for an appointment that was scheduled for 2:00pm. She was told that she was an hour early to her surprise as she thought her appointment was at 1:00. She politely said she would like to reschedule as she had a job interview at 2:15. 

No problem. She scheduled with the front desk while I made small talk and asked her what she had applied for. She responded with ""Oh it's just a laundry attendant at an elderly home."" I told her, it's not JUST a laundry attendant and she shouldn't sell herself short that she's doing a job that's JUST a laundry attendant. Honestly, nothing beats that feeling of getting into a nicely made warm bed that smells like fresh laundry. Plus there are 100 other things she could be doing instead of trying to make an honest dollar. 

She laughed and said ""I'm just so nervous, I lost my uncle a couple days ago and I just really hope I get this job."" At this point, she started to tear up, saying  it's been so hard for her and she's glad she got the appointment wrong and that she felt good having stopped in before her interview. 

Hugs were made and about 7 people cheered for her as she left. 

She has her appointment on Monday and I really hope she got it.

Are you resisting it? Take a moment and sense what you feel in your body. Are you tensing up? Sit in it for a moment. Just allow yourself to feel what you feel right here, right now.\n\nNow, if there's tension in you, can you let go of some of it? Feel your body drop as you do. And let go of a little more... and a little more. That's it.\n\nWhen you learn to be comfortable with what you feel regardless of what it is, you learn to integrate back who you really are, what you really think and feel. And that's when you learn to be naturally confident, because it takes a truly confident person to allow themselves to be a little vulnerable and let themselves be one with the moment and with their true self.\n\nWhen you're ready I have a few great exercises you can try when you're out. They're small things.\n\nExercise #1: When you're out walking, hold eye contact with the next person you pass. Try to let go of it only after they do. Notice how that felt.\n\nExercise #2: Ask the next stranger you meet what the time is.\n\nExercise #3: Same as above but also make small talk for 30 seconds.\n\nOf course, improving your social skills is one thing. But what about the other things in your life? Do you exercise? Try lifting. Is your home in order? If not, take a look around you. Do you see something you can do now to make it better? Do it. Are you procrastrinating on things you know you have to do? Get started on one of them.\n\nWhen you build great habits, you build great character and with it comes everything.\n\n:)"", 'Welcome üòÅ']",9,"[""Thanks for that!

You offered to wash my car window for a dollar. I would have gladly given you $20 if I carried any cash.

&amp;#x200B;

When i said ""No, I'm sorry.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Its okay, have a good day, God Bless you,"" you said with a smile.

Ugh, my heart strings were pulled.

&amp;#x200B;

So I went inside and bought a water. Thinking back I wish I bought two or 3. Then I came out and offered you the water, and holy shit balls, your face lit up. The sheer look of surprise you had, that anyone actually gave a shit if you were okay.

&amp;#x200B;

""Thank you sir!"" quickly drinking the bottle.

I then asked if I could sit with you. 

You welcomed the company.

I introduced myself and shook your hand.

You said your name is Renee.

Offering some pizza, you declined, ""Nono, it's okay. My stomach,"" you grimaced, rubbing it, ""it hurts and I don't feel too good right now.""

We then started to talk.

He never learned how to read or write. He suffers from hallucinations and his family never understood nor got him the treatment he needed. He'd held jobs and worked hard his entire life, but what savings he had, his mother took from him and kicked him out of the house. Tired of his mental conditions. Police were called, he was never listened to and told to leave. His brothers and sisters are fed up with him as well.

&amp;#x200B;

He'd been on the street since. Can't even fucking read a street sign.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing he owned were the clothes on his back, his grey hat, and his black drawstring bag. He told me how he eats his skin and nails because he can't kind food sometimes. Others, he feels there are worms crawling under his skin. Where all he has now is Providence and faith, that he knows he will be okay even if he (\*Renee points across the street) sleeps under a tiny infant tree that offered no shelter.

&amp;#x200B;

Not gonna lie, I cried my eyes out most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did not care about the people walking by us, not even the rich bitch in her blue mustang and white heels scoffing at me as she walked by talking on her phone.

&amp;#x200B;

But I listened and I cried talking to him.

Told Renee point blank, how the hell could I walk by, dressed in nice clothes, driving a beat up but perfectly fine car, with money and time to spare for pizza, and not see a human fucking being begging for work. Not money, work. 

How could I, not care? and looking back, I wish I could have done more. At the very least buy him more water. Offer to meet him after work and drive him somewhere he might need to go.

&amp;#x200B;

And I did tell him, ""I wish there was more I could do for you.""

He comforted me back and made it clear that I helped him more than I could understand. Well, he's right. I don't because its still a regret I could have not done more. That feeling is something I will always carry with me till the day I die. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even more regret are the things I take for granted, and the fact I forgot about him for these past 6 months. Dealing with the trauma from my abusive ex gf, while I have food to eat, a safe place to sleep that isn't crawling with bugs, a job, a car, friends who do care about me, and my physical health. Hell, I take for granted the fact I can read and write.

&amp;#x200B;

When my hour long lunch was over, I had to go back to work. I left you there still sobbing, and cried some more when i cleaned myself up in the bathroom at the office. I was late coming back.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw you again a month later, and stopped at the store to buy you food and water.

But you were gone when I came back. I should have parked and said hi first.

&amp;#x200B;

I every day I drive past that Little Caesars I look for you on the side of the road, hoping to see you. Then hoping you needn't be there.

&amp;#x200B;

Truly I do hope you are okay. I hope you are well, with a roof over your head, warm food in your belly; a soft, safe place to sleep; the ability to read, and a place free from the demons of your mind.

Maybe someone will find it helpful as well :)

I have been working in an IT team for several months and the longer I work the more upset I am. The most annoying thing to me is people in my team don't really care about their job. I hear other departments share the same complaints about us all the time, and nothing has changed. It seems like people are OK with having a low performance IT team in the company, and they don't expect anything good.

At first I had a strong opinion about my colleagues' attitude towards work, but after chatting with friends and hearing that this happens everywhere, I started to ask myself, was I wrong? Shouldn't we be serious about what we do for work and do it well? The work ethic I learned and the reality of this job has a large gap.

I told this to my husband and first he asked, what was the reason behind my colleagues apathy? Was it learned? Maybe in the past they cared or even cared too much, but got hurt somehow, so they stop caring. As a new employee, there has been too much politics and behind the scene stories that I've been missing. I only see the results. 

&gt;""Are you afraid you will be the same after working 10 years there too? Apathy is self-protection. It is a human thing and nothing is wrong about it. The question is why are they apathetic.""

I don't want to be that way. Being responsible at work is a very basic thing for me. If the environment makes people not care about what they do, the place itself is a problem. I can't say after 10 years, but at least now, I care about what I do and I want to learn and do things right.

&gt;""Can you change it?""

If I can, how? If the culture is there, it's not gonna change overnight. And ultimately the question is do I want to do it? Am I able to do it? I guess not.

&gt;""What if we looked at other jobs that don't have similar problems? Like the jobs that most people are happy doing?

So we looked at job satisfaction indexes on Google. There was a survey of how happy/satisfied are employees in their current job or industry.

Basically the info is here: [https://www.totaljobs.com/insidejob/job-satisfaction-index/](https://www.totaljobs.com/insidejob/job-satisfaction-index/)

The survey questions were interesting:

* Can you picture yourself at your company in a year?
* Are you looking for another job during your work time?
* Have you received training last year?
* Are your ideas being heard?
* Is your job important to your employer's success?
* Does your boss support your career goals?

We compared my personal answer and the survey results of my industry. Also from the survey, he quickly found 4 types of jobs that got higher self-reported scores (not precisely): transport, social care, logistics, HR. 

This process of comparing my answers with the survey was helpful because it made me realize the problem wasn't just about me or my work place, but something that a lot of IT people feel.

&gt;""Which ones do you like better in the list?"" He asked, ""maybe being a technical recruiter could be a good choice? Something more about HR?""

He is right. 

I felt much better after talking with him. I not only gained some compassion for my colleagues, but also found some hope in a future career path. The whole conversation pointed me towards what I can do next. Even though this may not be an ultimate solution, it was enough to help me open my eyes and look for more opportunities instead of only feeling upset.

Like the same dimension, but not this one. They're all cannon and could be part of a comic book series or something. I remember dreams I had as a toddler and I am almost 40. They keep coming back to me. My dreams have always been vivid. This could all be totally normal for all I know though. 

There is a whole series of dreams where I am trying to get to a concert/movie/event at a hotel or wherever else where people I know are, and I always make it to my destination except that I will get lost in the hotel for hours and never find what I am looking for, or like last night, I got to where the concert was, but then I somehow fell asleep outside of the theater on a bench, and I missed everything. If at the end I do connect with whomever I was going to see, they don't really notice me, and it's as if I am a ghost. I remember having these dreams pre-elementary school too. 

The other weird set of dreams I have is where people are living in my house, and I don't know it. These started at one apartment where I lived, and in those dreams, my apartment was my actual apartment, except that there was a room I didn't know about, which was between the storage closet, and the bathroom. The room was in the same place in every dream. And in each dream, I randomly discovered I had a roommate when I would see them in the apartment. And they had been living there for a long time. I just never noticed (600 square foot apartment too). 

Then the dreams switched to random houses after I moved to another state. I would discover hidden parts of my house where there were people living. In the first house dream, there was a mortuary in my basement in the dream, that I never knew was there, and a family that ran it. In a couple of the dreams, I noticed a door, and behind it was another house that was connected. Each time I had one of these dreams, the house would appear to be abandoned, but then I would find out eventually that it wasn't, usually while I was in that house. 

Whenever I have dreams about my mom or siblings, they always take place at my childhood home. In each dream, people are invading and trying to come into the house. I never want them to, and I am always frightened.
